### I Used to be a Gamer

The high school version of me would be disappointed in how I turned out. I used to be a prolific gamer, and for several years I considered it a real part of my identity. It made me who I am. I still credit video games with getting me into Computer Science because it all started with wanting to make a video game of my own. My particular taste had been for console RPGs, which I first met in the Genesis / Super Nintendo era and running until it tapered off somewhere during the run of the Playstation 2.

Tonight I felt a compulsion to spend a bit of time playing some of my old favorites for a bit again. Going through a box in my basement, I found a handful of Playstation games that I thought might be worth revisiting briefly, and it took me another half an hour to dig out my Playstation 2 and relevant cables. I never did find a PS2 controller - maybe lost in a move. Thankfully the games I was most interested in were PS1 titles that were fine with the original PS1 controller.

I spent some time with four different games before getting lost in thought about how exactly my tastes have developed in the years since. Here's how the experience went:

### Grandia

I started my nostalgia trip with Grandia, for no particular reason other than having fond memories of it and it being one of the first I found in the box. I'd really forgotten how juvenile this game is, at least at the start.

### Suikoden 2

I decided before long that I wanted something a bit more serious or mature than Grandia, so I switched to Suikoden 2. My memory of the game is of being very drawn in by the story, and its ending in particular. For those familiar with it, I refer to the unhappy ending, which I always thought was more fitting and interesting than the contrived happiest ending.

As an aside, it's strange to me to realize that I own a Playstation game that I could apparently sell for well over $100 on eBay. Huh.

### Castlevania: Symphony of the Night

As much as RPGs were my normal genre, this game hooked me much more than the others. It was just immediately compelling to jump around fighting skeletons, and if I hadn't gotten myself thinking too much I could have spent quite a bit of the night at this. I actually left the game running for a while just to listen to some of the music while I contemplated exactly what happened to Gamer Eric.

### Breath of Fire 3



### What Happened

I think there were essentially three things that got me out of RPGs, and thereby video games as whole. The first was simply college - my life just gave me less time to get involved with these sorts of games, and when I did play games they tended to be more of a social variety. Sometimes I still miss some of the Guitar Hero and Rock Band sessions I had with friends. The second is that I got tired of formulaic plots. Grandia especially reminded me of this - I couldn't even count all of the games I've played that follow a similar path of "kid from a humble background gets caught up in an adventure culminating in saving the world from ultimate evil." Finally, I just got tired of the level of interactivity involved. I spent so much time tonight just walking around and choosing options out of menus. That never used to bother me, but I just don't have the patience for it anymore. If I want to read, I'd prefer a book. If I want to watch cutscenes, I'd prefer a movie. Video games are defined by interactivity, and diluting that with other media is 

I sometimes consider Metal Gear Solid 3 as having been the final nail in the coffin for my life as a gamer.
