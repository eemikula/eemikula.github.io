<h1>Mountain Lions on a Treadmill</h1>

<h2>$856,000</h2>

"People just didn't believe you could get a mountain lion on a treadmill, and it took me three years to find a facility that was willing to try," exclaimed Terrie Williams, a University of California-Santa Cruz professor.139 Tim Stephens, "Study of mountain lion energetics shows the power of the pounce," University of California-Santa Cruz News Center, October 2, 2014; http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/10/puma-energetics.html .
What people won't have a hard time believing is the federal government would pay to put the big cats on a treadmill. Not so long ago, after all, the National Science Foundation
(NSF) paid $560,000 to run a shrimp on a tiny treadmill.140 "The National Science Foundation: Under the Microscope," Office of Senator Tom Coburn, M.D., April 2011; http://www.coburn.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?a=Files.serve140File_id=2dccf06d-65fe-4087-b58d-b43ff68987fa . In fact, the federal government has raced animals, large and small on a treadmill from monkeys,141 to rats,142 and even cow and goats.144 Arnold, Allison S; Lee, David V; Biewener, Andrew A, "Modulation of joint moments and work in the goat hindlimb with locomotor speed and surface grade," TheJournal of experimental biology. 2013 Jun 15; 216 (Pt 12) :2201-12. http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=7080442144icde=22168695 A mountain lion that has been trained to run on the testing treadmill.

In this study funded with an $856,000 NSF grant, three captive mountain lions were taught to use a treadmill.145 "ANIMA (Accelerometer Network Integrator for Mobile Animals), a New Instrument Package for Integrating Behavior, Physiology and Ecology of Wild Mammals,"Award Abstract #0963022, National Science Foundation award database website, accessed October 17, 2014; http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0963022145HistoricalAwards=false . It took eight months of training before the cats were "comfortable on the treadmill."146 Tim Stephens, "Study of mountain lion energetics shows the power of the pounce," University of California-Santa Cruz News Center, October 2, 2014; http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/10/puma-energetics.html .
The study, which also monitored wild mountain lions with a special collar, determined the "power of the pounce" and the energy consumption of the cat's hunting techniques. Before the researchers "could interpret the data from collars deployed on wild mountain lions, however, they first had to perform calibration studies with mountain lions in captivity. This meant, among other things, training

mountain lions to walk and run on a treadmill and measuring their oxygen consumption at different activity levels. Those studies took a bit longer than planned."147 Tim Stephens, "Study of mountain lion energetics shows the power of the pounce," University of California-Santa Cruz News Center, October 2, 2014; http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/10/puma-energetics.html .
The treadmill study found "mountain lions do not have the aerobic capacity for sustained,
high-energy activity.148 Tim Stephens, "Study of mountain lion energetics shows the power of the pounce," University of California-Santa Cruz News Center, October 2, 2014; http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/10/puma-energetics.html .
"They are power animals. They have a slow routine walking speed and use a burst of speed and the force of the pounce to knock down or overpower their prey," Williams explains.
"In addition to the treadmill studies, the captive cats were videotaped wearing the collars while doing a wide range of activities in a large outdoor enclosure. This provided a library of collar acceleration signatures specific for different behaviors, from resting and grooming to running and pouncing."149 Tim Stephens, "Study of mountain lion energetics shows the power of the pounce," University of California-Santa Cruz News Center, October 2, 2014; http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/10/puma-energetics.html .
A "state-of-the-art" collar-called the Species Movement, Acceleration, and Radio Tracking (SMART) wildlife collar- was designed by a graduate student for the studies in the wild. The high tech collar includes a GPS unit, accelerometers, and a magnetometer "to provide detailed data on where an animal is and what it is doing."150 Tim Stephens, "Study of mountain lion energetics shows the power of the pounce," University of California-Santa Cruz News Center, October 2, 2014; http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/10/puma-energetics.html .
The researchers say the "insights are likely to greatly inform public knowledge and opinion of large mammal behavior and conservation."151 "ANIMA (Accelerometer Network Integrator for Mobile Animals), a New Instrument Package for Integrating Behavior, Physiology and Ecology of Wild Mammals,"Award Abstract #0963022, National Science Foundation award database website, accessed October 17, 2014; http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0963022151HistoricalAwards=false .
The NSF funds were also spent on "outreach," which included attending conferences and developing an interactive website.152 "ANIMA (Accelerometer Network Integrator for Mobile Animals), a New Instrument Package for Integrating Behavior, Physiology and Ecology of Wild Mammals,"Award Abstract #0963022, National Science Foundation award database website, accessed October 17, 2014; http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0963022152HistoricalAwards=false .
While support for basic science is not itself wasteful, federal research agencies should better prioritize how tax dollars are directed to ensure adequate support for more pressing scientific endeavors. With Congress racking up deficits and leaving nearly an $18 trillion debt for the next generation, scarce resources should be used to pay down the debt or on higher priorities, such as emerging biological threats that could pounce on anyone of us.

The feeling of anger caused by hunger is so well-known that pop culture has given the feelings their own name: hanger. Armed with voodoo dolls and chalkboard noises, federally funded researchers wanted to prove a hangry spouse is also an unhappy one.
to stick up to 51 pins into a voodoo doll representing their spouse.173 Bushman, Brad J., C. Nathan DeWall, Richard S. Pond Jr., and Michael D. Hanus.

The pin-pushing happened in secret, away from the other partner.
Participants then recorded the number of pins they poked into the dolls. Those tests revealed what may already be obvious to many couples:
a spouse with low blood sugar was an angrier one, and stuck more pins in the doll (on average).174 Bushman, Brad J., C. Nathan DeWall, Richard S. Pond Jr., and Michael D. Hanus.

<h1>Subsidies for Sports Stadiums Leave Taxpayers Holding the Bill</h1>

<h2>$146 million</h2>

For millions of sports fans, Fall in America means watching the first weeks of football season and catching baseball playoff games from the comfort of their couch. Many of these exciting showdowns are played in spectacular new stadiums largely paid for in part with taxfree financing. Yet, with some tickets costing hundreds of dollars, many taxpayers cannot afford to attend a game or enjoy the stadiums they helped build.
Through the use of municipal bonds,
state and local governments are able to finance the building of multi-million dollar sporting arenas to support their favorite local team and wealthy franchise owners. The interest earned by investors on these bonds is not subject to federal income tax, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in lost federal revenue.
The only loser in this game is the taxpayer.
This tax preference for the pros costs the government $146 million in lost revenue every year, in tax exemptions on interest from

government bonds for sporting facilities,
according to a Bloomberg analysis of U.S.
Treasury data.<sup>[<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-05/in-stadium-building-spree-u-s-taxpayers-lose-4-billion.html" title=" Kuriloff, Aaron and Darrell Preston. &quot;In Stadium Building Spree, U.S. Taxpayers Lose $4 Billion.&quot; Bloomberg.com.

Dallas Cowboy fans may not cheer quite as loud this year considering their unrivaled new stadium was financed by government bonds, resulting in more than $65 million in subsidies to investors over the next 29 years.<sup>[<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-05/in-stadium-building-spree-u-s-taxpayers-lose-4-billion.html" title=" Kuriloff, Aaron and Darrell Preston. &quot;In Stadium Building Spree, U.S. Taxpayers Lose $4 Billion.&quot; Bloomberg.com.

On the East Coast, New York's beloved Yankees are hitting homeruns in the second most expensive baseball stadium ever built,192 in part thanks to $942 million in tax-free financing, resulting in revenue losses of at least $231 million over 30 years.<sup>[<a href="http://taxfoundation.org/article/house-ruth-built-house-irs-built" title=" Henchman, Joseph and Travis Greaves. &quot;From the House That Ruth Building to the House the IRS Built.&quot Taxfoundation.org. The Tax Foundation. 9 April 2009.">193</a>]</sup>
These aren't the only teams winning

big, even if they lose a game or two in their swanky stadiums. Bloomberg's investigation revealed, "There are 21 NFL owners whose teams play in stadiums built or renovated in the past quarter-century using tax-free public borrowing. Such municipal debt helped build structures used by 64 major-league teams,
including baseball, hockey and basketball."<sup>[<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-05/in-stadium-building-spree-u-s-taxpayers-lose-4-billion.html" title=" Kuriloff, Aaron and Darrell Preston. &quot; In Stadium Building Spree, U.S. Taxpayers Lose $4 Billion.&quot; Bloomberg.com. Bloomberg L.P. 5 September 2012. ">194</a>]</sup>
The exclusion of interest from the income tax functions as a federal subsidy through the tax code for state and local government borrowing and for the team owners who do not have to put up as much of their own money. The direct tax subsidy is claimed by the investors who do not pay taxes on the interest earned from these bonds.
The federal tax preference for pro stadiums was not created intentionally, and in fact, Congress specifically attempted to prohibit tax-exempt financing of stadiums.
But, Congress left the door open for local governments to use tax-free municipal bonds to help build the stadiums with taxpayer help.<sup>[<a href="http://www.gao.gov/assets/280/272369.pdf" title=" Brostek, Michael.

are supposed to be used to finance capital projects such as buildings, utilities, and transportation infrastructure,196 not subsidize athletic arenas for multi-million dollar sports franchises.
Congress should leave the game playing to the professionals and stop asking taxpayers to take a penalty for the home team.

Watching Grass Grow

<h2>$10,000</h2>

The federal government is literally paying people to watch grass grow.
While the grass being observed,
saltmarsh cordgrass is "a fast-growing plant," it can reach a length of 6 inches to as high as 7 feet tall.<sup>[<a href="http://www.edc.uri.edu/restoration/html/gallery/plants/smooth.htm" title=" University of Rhode Island Environmental Data Center. &quot;Smooth Cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora).&quot Edc.uri.edu.

The Department of Interior's U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is spending $10,000 on the project being conducted in the GuanaTolomato-Matanzas preserve by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection
(FDEP). The money will "cover the cost to monitor grasses, restore two acres as a demonstration and publish a guide on bestpractices for cultivating the cordgrass, known formally as Spartina alterniflora"<sup>[<a href="http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2014-08-11/story/guana-marsh-research-sheds-new-light-old-florida-environment" title=" Patterson, Steve. &quot;In Guana Marsh, Research Sheds New Light On Old Florida Environment.&quotJacksonville.com. The Florida Times-Union. 11 August 2014. ">213</a>]</sup>
"Spartina is used a lot now in places that aren't natural, from highway berms and ridges to manicured golf courses," according to the vice president of Beeman's Nursery in New Smyrna Beach.<sup>[<a href="http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2014-08-11/story/guana-marsh-research-sheds-new-light-old-florida-environment" title=" Patterson, Steve. &quot;In Guana Marsh, Research Sheds New Light On Old Florida Environment.&quotJacksonville.com. The Florida Times-Union. 11 August 2014. ">214</a>]</sup>
"About 40,000 plugs of Spartina will be pulled individually" out of salt marsh and observers will "painstakingly document how fast it returns."<sup>[<a href="http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2014-08-11/story/guana-marsh-research-sheds-new-light-old-florida-environment" title="Patterson, Steve. &quot;In Guana Marsh, Research Sheds New Light On Old Florida Environment.&quotJacksonville.com. The Florida Times-Union. 11 August 2014. ">215</a>]</sup>
"Where plugs of grass are removed,
photos are run through computer software to figure the number of plants still standing and

how much ground they cover. A chest-high square of PVC-like tubing with strings pulled into a grid makes it easier to track growth and thinning in the grasses."<sup>[<a href="http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2014-08-11/story/guana-marsh-research-sheds-new-light-old-florida-environment" title=" Patterson, Steve. &quot;In Guana Marsh, Research Sheds New Light On Old Florida Environment.&quotJacksonville.com. The Florida Times-Union. 11 August 2014. ">216</a>]</sup>
What lessons might be learned from watching the grass grown back? "Grasses that are thinned differently from one grid to another could end up pointing to lessons in the grass's resilience. If 20 percent of the Spartina is pulled out in one grid and grows back as completely as the grass in an area where only 10 percent was taken," the project's restoration coordinator said "it could mean there's no apparent effect from taking that much more."<sup>[<a href="http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2014-08-11/story/guana-marsh-research-sheds-new-light-old-florida-environment" title=" Patterson, Steve. &quot;In Guana Marsh, Research Sheds New Light On Old Florida Environment.&quotJacksonville.com. The Florida Times-Union. 11 August 2014. ">217</a>]</sup>
While the project may yield some new understandings of how to grow cordgrass,
it looks more like just another weed of government waste in the federal budget.
There are much more pressing challenges facing our nation that we should focus on than watching grass grow.

<h1>U.S. Coast Guard Party Patrols</h2>

<h2>$100,000 or more</h2>

Faced with budget cuts, the U.S. Coast Guard reduced drug and migrant interdictions while continuing to provide free patrols in the waters along "some of the country's most exclusive real estate" to stop uninvited guests from crashing private parties.
While taxpayers appreciate the crucial role the Coast Guard serves protecting our nation's waterways and rescuing nearly 5,000 people a year,255 most are probably unaware its crewmen also serve as bouncers to keep the general public and other uninvited guests out of private events on and along yachts, beaches,and estates.
"For some regattas, yacht club parties and even weddings, the maritime agency assigns boats and crews to enforce 'safety zones,'" like
"it does for public fireworks displays such as the Macy's Fourth of July celebration in New York City."<sup>[<a href="http://nypost.com/2014/09/09/taxpayers-cover-coast-guards-private-party-patrols/" title=" Christofferson, John.

However, some of the orchestra's older patrons complained, fearing the symphony would follow suit the Florida Orchestra, which tried to draw in a younger crowd with music from popular video games.<sup>[<a href="http://www.vocativ.com/culture/music/colorado-symphonywooing-stoners-donors-arent-happy/" title=" Nestel, M.L., "Symphony for Stoners Is Not a Hit with Donors."

private events that receive safety zones are clear that the intent is not to benefit the public,"
according to the Associated Press.
In July, "two orange boats carrying nine Coast Guard service members, all clad in body armor and some carrying handguns," were stations in Long Island Sound. Their mission:
Keep other boaters away from a "barge launching celebratory fireworks" for a wedding party on Glen Island, "which is connected to the mainland by a drawbridge and taken up mostly by a park that was first developed as a summer resort by a congressman in the 19th century."<sup>[<a href="http://nypost.com/2014/09/09/taxpayers-cover-coast-guards-private-party-patrols/" title=" Christofferson, John. &quot;Taxpayers Cover Coast Guard's Private-Party Patrols.&quot Nypost.com.

"The 15-minute display cost close to

"This is a world-class Grucci choreographed barge," bragged DeSalvo said.

afford $100,000 for just the fireworks display,
they did not have to pay a cent for the security of their event, which was provided as an inkind wedding present from the taxpayers.
The Coast Guard boats arrived around 8 p.m., "when they turned on blue law enforcement lights. Petty Officer 2nd Class Geoffrey Burns sounded a siren as they pulled up to" an uninvited boat. "I need you to go this way," Burns instructed the boater.<sup>[<a href="http://nypost.com/2014/09/09/taxpayers-cover-coast-guards-private-party-patrols/" title=" Christofferson, John. &quot;Taxpayers Cover Coast Guard's Private-Party Patrols.&quot Nypost.com.

"We're not protecting the wedding.

The Associated Press found "active-duty Coast Guard crews are involved in security for dozens of privately sponsored events"
just in New York and the Long Island Sound,

however, is unable to estimate the actual cost for patrolling private party safety zones

and "the deployment of resources varies for each event." <sup>[<a href="http://nypost.com/2014/09/09/taxpayers-cover-coast-guards-private-party-patrols/" title=" Christofferson, John. &quot;Taxpayers Cover Coast Guard's Private-Party Patrols.&quot Nypost.com.

however, that "a manual of Coast Guard reimbursement rates lists small response boats at about $1,500 per hour and medium-size boats at more than $8,000 per hour, in the event they are dispatched for what turns out to be a hoax."<sup>[<a href="http://nypost.com/2014/09/09/taxpayers-cover-coast-guards-private-party-patrols/" title=" Christofferson, John.

Time Inc. 25 April 2009.">269</a>]</sup>] So the Coast Guard is likely forfeiting $100,000 or more in just the New York area alone this year that could be collected in re-imbursements and put towards drug interdiction efforts elsewhere.
Even last year at the height of sequestration's impact as the Coast Guard reduced "its on-the-water operations around Long Island by as much as 25 percent," it continued "to help with the planning and then be present at larger events such as the Memorial Day weekend air show at Jones Beach State Park."<sup>[<a href="http://www.newsday.com/long-island/coast-guard-to-cutoperations-around-li-1.4932678" title=" Bleyer, Bill. &quot;Coast Guard to Cut Operations Around LI.&quot Newsday.com.

tremendous waste of assets." "We've got good ships and good people out there that want to do their jobs, but putting fuel in ships is one of the most expensive things we do, and during sequestration the only option we had was to cut money out of operations," according to Papp. Faced with $200 million in budget cuts under sequester, Papp claimed "the only place

that we could squeeze it a little bit was in drug interdiction and migrant interdiction."<sup>[<a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-113hhrg88023/html/CHRG-113hhrg88023.htm" title=" Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security.

Yet "the New Haven-based Long Island Sound sector of the Coast Guard deployed active-duty vessels, auxiliary Coast Guard boats or both for most of the safety zones involving fireworks displays last year,
according to Lt. Ben Duarte, the sector's chief of waterways management. Of 60 safety zones listed in the sector's register last year,
the agency said, 21 were sponsored by a city or town. The rest were privately sponsored,
including many fireworks displays put on by yacht clubs and beach clubs" and a privately sponsored fireworks display by the owners of the Foxwoods Resort Casino. "In the New York sector, 31 of 43 safety zones last year were supported by active-duty Coast Guard.
About half of the events are typically privately sponsored."<sup>[<a href="http://www.newsday.com/long-island/coast-guard-to-cutoperations-around-li-1.4932678" title=" Bleyer, Bill. &quot;Coast Guard to Cut Operations Around LI.&quot Newsday.com. Newsday. 28 March 2013. ">273</a>]</sup>
The Coast Guard's vital missions should not be compromised by spending limited resources deploying crews to interdict party crashers rather than drugs dealers or others who pose a threat to the security of our nation.

While the Coast Guard reduced drug and migrant interdictions, the maritime agency continued to provide free patrols to interdict potential uninvited guests from crashing exclusive private parties on 17 yachts and beaches, costing thousands of dollars per event.

<h1>Penn State Shame Study Asks How To Boost Morale After Scandal</h1>

<h2>$41,000</h2>

Disgraced in the wake of the revelation that a Penn State assistant football coach had been sexually abusing children for years, and the cover up that ensued, Penn State is turning its public shame into public subsidies.
Former football coaching assistant Jerry Sandusky has been convicted of sexually abusing ten boys and the former school president,
vice president and athletic director are awaiting trial for allegedly attempting to cover-up the scandal.<sup>[<a href="http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/11489258/ncaa-drops-postseason-ban-penn-state-nittany-lions" title=" Moyer, Josh. &quot;Penn State's Postseason Ban Over.&quot ESPN.com.

Accessed 16 October 2014. http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1260929 .
"Employees vary in their organizational identification, the extent they view themselves as personally connected to and part of their workorganization," the researchers note. "When the organization is doing well, such identification can benefit self-concept, motivational energy,
and health, which is especially beneficial for front-line employees because they actually feel the enthusiasm and pride they need to express to potential clients or donors. Paradoxically, organizational identification can become a liability if the organization becomes associated with scandal or stigma, such that one's pride-by-association turns to feelings of shame and betrayal. In such cases, those who are the most motivated become those who are most threatened; how do such employees respond, and how does this affect their health and performance? To answer these questions, a current real-life event,
the scandal at Pennsylvania State University, provides a unique timesensitive context."310 National Science Foundation. "RAPID: When Pride Becomes Shame: Organizational Identification and Self-Presentation During Scandal." Award Abstract#1260929. Accessed 16 October 2014. http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1260929 .
While it is a good thing for everyone to learn from the school's mistakes and to protect students and employees who are not responsible for the inappropriate actions or inactions of others within an organization, taxpayers should not have to subsidize the school's self-reflection in scandal and shame.

Promoting U.S. Culture Around the Globe with Nose Flutists,
State Department Idol

<h2>$90 million</h2>

The State Department spent taxpayer dollars to dispel the perceptions of Pakistani journalists that Americans are not all "fat,
rude, and cold."311 Joe Little, Perceptions of Americans change after 3-week visit from Pakistani journalists, ABC10 NEWS (Mar. 31, 2014) http://www.10news.com/news/perceptionsof-americans-change-after-3-week-visit-from-pakistani-journalists-03312014.

In total, the State Department spends
$90 million annually on cultural exchange programs. These exchange programs are intended to increase understanding between the U.S. and "the people of other countries by means of educational and cultural exchange that assist in the development of peaceful relations," that are intended to "build cross-cultural bridges across the globe.313 About the Bureau, DEP'T OF STATE, http://eca.state.gov/about-bureau. 314 that assist in the development of peaceful relations," that are intended to "build cross-cultural bridges across the globe.313 314 Congressional Budget Justification FY15, DEP'T OF STATE, at 401, http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/223495.pdf.Here are more examples of how the State Department spends $90 million to bridge the gap between the U.S. and other the rest of the world.

Many apply for the opportunity to tour the world on the taxpayer dime, and the grant recipient selects ten bands on the basis of "musical

talent" and "strong educational programs,
aptitude in arranging music from around the world and for their capacity to conduct effective cultural diplomacy programs."316 Email from grantee (July 18, 2014) (on file with the Office of Senate Coburn). The State Department directly participates in the selection of bands and a government official served as a judge for this year's program.317 Email from grantee (July 18, 2014) (on file with the Office of Senate Coburn).
The judges went to three live auditions held in New York City, St. Louis and San Francisco all at taxpayer's expense.318 Email from grantee (July 18, 2014) (on file with the Office of Senate Coburn).

This year, a rapper will be touring the world who recently released a song titled "Dem Shawts," which includes the following colorful lyrics: I can't help but stare when you're walking past though/Yo I can't lie-y'all got some ass though/If you don't want me looking, what the hell you wear 'em for?320 See Arkansas Bo 320 Big Piph, Dem Shawts, Audiomack (last accessed Oct. 1, 2014), https://www.audiomack.com/song/arkansas-bo-big-piph/3-them-shawtsmaster His recent album also features cover art where a woman is aiming a shotgun at the artist's head.321 See Big Piph, The Calm (EP) (last accessed Oct. 1, 2014), http://www.bigpiph.com/music/.
International Band Camp - Through its grant to Bang on a Can, the State Department is spending $1 million on OneBeat, a program that gathers artists from across the world in one location for a month in Florida where they collaborate and create music, after which they travel the country the taxpayer dime to perform and connect with one another.322 See OneBeat, Bang on A Can (last accessed Oct. 1, 2014), http://bangonacan.org/found_sound_nation/one_beat The website for OneBeat describes the program as "a musical journey like no other."323 See OneBeat, Bang on A Can (last accessed Oct. 1, 2014), http://bangonacan.org/found_sound_nation/one_beat In , the artists formed a flash mob at a Wal-Mart and uploaded a video of it onto

YouTube and aptly labeled it "Ruckus."324 Found Sound Nation, OneBeat 2012 - Walmart Ruckus, Youtube (last accessed Oct. 1, 2014), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3KuFJCOsM4324list=PLkLzOTNw7TRTsUS9l0l3WrrCQQplPRdXc In

balloons and corrugated tubing.325 Found Sound Nation, OneBeat 2013 - Making Instruments, Youtube (last accessed Oct. 1, 2014), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vptM3aBjs_s325index=4325list=PLkLzOTNw7TRQ28XnTjOGYpT8TtSlE5P9B. Later that year, they toured the country and one of their stops included a Washington, DC venue where a Russian beatboxer, a guy "plucking"
his mustache, and a reggaeton artist who performed a song about government being
"on leave" and learning "how to represent."326 Found Sound Nation, OneBeat 2013 - Washington, Youtube (last accessed Oct. 1, 2014), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6MXBE_0dTA326list=PLkLzOTNw7TRQ28XnTjOGYpT8TtSlE5P9B#t=184.
The government was shut down at the time.
Not only is much of the cultural exchange funding not the best use of

taxpayer funds, the program is poorly run.
Often, only a portion of the grant funding is reaching the participants-the money is being spent, in large part, on expenses to run the organizations which include salaries and benefits and that can reach 30% of the amount awarded by agency.327 See, e.g., ACYPL; Bang on a Can; Global Nomads Group. Some grant recipients also budgeted or spent a substantial portion of their awards on honoraria costs, at times 15 or 20%, which presumably were paid to artists and other performers.328 See, e.g., Association of American Voices; Bang on a Can.

<h1>Golf Club Testing, Elementary School Experiments Aboard the International Space Station</h1>

<h2>$3 billion</h2>

It doesn't take a rocket scientist to design experiments on the International Space Station
(ISS). In fact, sixth graders and other elementary student are proposing some of the studies being conducted onboard the space station that is costing billions of dollars a year to operate.
ISS is one of the greatest achievements in manned spaceflight. It is also the "single most expensive object ever created."<sup>[<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/video/the-mostexpensive-object-ever-lives-in-space-oKuCsqCLR3akanG_eCWXUQ.html" title=" BloombergTV.&quot;The Most Expensive Object Ever (Lives in Space).&quot Bloomberg.com.

While some valuable research is being conducted on the station regarding life in space, the billions being spent to maintain the station could be directed towards much more meaningful studies or projects. The entire NASA budget for Fiscal Year  is $17.7 billion,342 meaning the space station consumes nearly one-fifth of the agency's resources.
The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy claims the station is necessary and the research conducted onboard has "already resulted in a number of discoveries with significant medical and industrial implications," including potential vaccines.<sup>[<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/01/08/obama-administration-extends-international-spacestation-until-least-2024" title=" Holdren, John P., and Charles Bolden. &quot;Obama Administration Extends International Space Station until at Least 2024.&quot Web log post.

"The station is a marvel," but "it hasn't yet proved it was worth the investment," says John Logsdon, the former director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University. "It's an awfully expensive engineering demonstration,"
according to Logsdon, who notes "if that's all it is,
that's a hell of a price to pay."<sup>[<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2013/09/14/the-skies-the-limits/" title=" Achenbach, Joel. &quot;The Skies. The Limits.

As far back as , James Van Allen, the pioneering astrophysicist, concluded "the cost of the space station is far beyond any justifiable scientific purpose or any justifiable practical purpose."345 Bond, Peter. The Continuing Story of the International Space Station. London: Springer, 2002. p279.
The studies conducted onboard the space station "are not remotely comparable to the
path-breaking research conducted by NASA's armada of orbiting telescopes and its robotic probes of distant planets," notes the New York Times.
The newspaper writes "when NASA threatened to abandon the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers rose in wrath. If the station disappeared tomorrow, the response would most likely be tepid."<sup>[<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/14/opinion/14sun1.html?pagewanted=all346_r=1346" title=" &quot;The New York Times Op-Ed.&quot Editorial.

And even though Congress "designated the ISS as a national laboratory" in , the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found
"research utilization has not been the priority" of the space station.
NASA has most recently averaged about 37.5 hours of research per week on the space station. It cost taxpayers about $1.5 million per hour for the research conducted there at that rate and given the  billion per year cost to operate ISS. The total cost of ISS to date has been about $100 billion,
and research since  has averaged about 30 hours a week, or 7,800 hours. If all costs to date are included over these 7,800 hours of estimated research, the cost of research is $12.8 million an hour.347 "NASA'S EFFORTS TO MAXIMIZE RESEARCH ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION," National Aeronautics and Space Administration Office of InspectorGeneral, July 8, 2013; http://oig.nasa.gov/audits/reports/FY13/IG-13-019.pdf .

NASA "faces challenges ... ensuring the station is fully utilized," according to GAO, which "has cautioned for years that NASA should ensure it has a capability to access and utilize the space station following retirement of the space shuttle."
GAO notes "NASA's decision to rely on the new commercial vehicles to transport cargo starting in  and to transport crew starting in 2017 is in 2012 and to transport crew starting in  is inherently risky because the vehicles are not yet proven and are experiencing delays in development.

NASA's Tower of Pork Protected by Politician

<h2>$44.5 million</h2>

From its launch in , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) captured the country's imagination and represented the new frontiers America was leading mankind.
Today, the agency-almost more than any other-represents the morass and politics of Washington,
D.C. The space agency can no longer send astronauts into space and less than half of its budget is even spent on the missions it was created to pursue, aeronautics research and space exploration and operations.<sup>[<a href="http://oig.nasa.gov/audits/reports/FY14/IG-14-012.pdf" title=" &quot;The proportion of NASA funds dedicated to aeronautics research has declined from approximately 6 percent in fiscal year (FY) 2005 to 3 percent today, dwarfedby the Agency's focus on space exploration and operations (44 percent) and scientific investments (22 percent),&quot according to the NASA OIG.NASA Office of Inspector General.

24Congress Blocks Closure of Unneeded "Sheep Station"

<h2>$1.98 million</h2>

Everyone knows how much Congress loves pork, but perhaps less well-known is its affinity for mutton.
Earlier this year, a congressional committee blocked the U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA) from closing down a $2 million-a-year sheep research site the agency said was no longer needed.<sup>[<a href="http://www.localnews8.com/news/us-sheep-experiment-station-toremain-open/26982086" title=" &quot;U.S. Sheep Experiment Station to remain open,&quot LocalNews8.com.

Known as the U.S. Sheep Experiment Station in Dubois, Idaho, its mission is "increasing production efficiency of sheep and to simultaneously improve the sustainability of rangeland ecosystems."<sup>[<a href="http://www.ars.usda.gov/main/site_main.htm?modecode=53-64-05-00" title=" U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service.

High Country News 18 January 2012. ">372</a>]</sup>
Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack proposed closing the sheep station saying in June it "no longer has the critical mass of scientists necessary to address high priority research."<sup>[<a href="http://amhealthmaster.http.internapcdn.net/AMHealthMaster/DOCUMENT/SheepUSA/USSES_Vilsack_to_Aberholt.pdf" title=" Letter from Thomas J.

Aderholt, Chairman of the U.S. House ofRepresentatives Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies, Committee on Appropriations. 17 June 2014,">373</a>]</sup>
A spokesperson with USDA said the station was one of several the agency found had "gotten to the point where, from a financial standpoint,
they're either marginally viable or they're just not sustainable."<sup>[<a href="http://missoulanews.bigskypress.com/IndyBlog/archives/2014/06/27/usda-approves-proposal-to-close-sheep-station-in-centennial-mountains" title=" Sakariassen, Alex. &quot;USDA Approves Proposal to Close Sheep Station in Centennial Mountains.&quot Missoulanews.com. Missoula Independent. 27 June 2014. ">374</a>]</sup>
Moreover, the cost of running the station became too expensive after losing $1.5 million fending off lawsuits from environmental groups.<sup>[<a href="http://www.idahostatesman.com/2014/06/27/3256761/tough-times-out-there-for-idahos.html" title=" Barker, Rocky. "Tough Times Out There for Idaho's Sheep Ranchers." Idahostatesman.com. Idaho Statesman. 27 June 2004.

Associated Press. 18 May 2013. ">376</a>]</sup>
Secretary Vilsack ultimately sided with the bears - believing they needed better access to sites like Yellowstone - and notified Congress in June of plans to close the Sheep Experiment Station in Dubois, Idaho and reallocate its
$1,984,000 in annual funding to strengthen higher priority research.<sup>[<a href="http://amhealthmaster.http.internapcdn.net/AMHealthMaster/DOCUMENT/SheepUSA/USSES_Vilsack_to_Aberholt.pdf" title=" Letter from Thomas J.

That was the point when Congress stepped in, however, to insist the sheep station remain open. Citing an obscure provision of law giving congressional committees the ability to stop the USDA's plans, members from Idaho,
Washington, Montana and Oregon joined forces to insist the closure be halted.<sup>[<a href="http://amhealthmaster.http.internapcdn.net/AMHealthMaster/DOCUMENT/SheepUSA/Dubois_USSES_6_26_14.pdf" title=" Letter from Representatives Mike Simpson, Doc Hastings, Greg Walden, Cathy McMorris-Rodgers, Steve Daines, and Raul Labrador to Representative RobertAderholt, Chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies,Committee on Appropriations, June 26, 2014, ">378</a>]</sup>

Idaho's governor, Butch Otter, joined in the protest, saying he wanted to protect homestate businesses, "We want to keep it open. The sheep business is big business in Idaho and will continue to be big business in Idaho, we hope."<sup>[<a href="http://www.postregister.com/articles/newstodays-headlines/2014/06/26/clark-county-employer-likely-closing-down" title=" Wieber, Aubrey. &quot;Clark County Employer Likely Closing Down.&quot Postregister.com.

The decision to keep the sheep station open, however, drew a sharp rebuke from environmental groups, which called the sheep station, "another subsidy to an industry that is already subsidized" with low fees and direct federal funding.<sup>[<a href="http://www.thewildlifenews.com/2014/07/16/sheep-experiment-station-closure-thwarted-by-political-interference/" title=" Western Watershed Project.

One Idaho newspaper directly accused Idaho representative Mike Simpson - who intervened to keep the sheep station open - of helping drive up the national debt, saying, "If the sheep industry truly deems this facility's work to be vital, the sheep industry should fund it.

Spray Parks and "Splashpads"
Help Beat The Summer Heat

<h2>$3.5 million</h2>

Water cannons, lazy rivers and water slides are all part of one federal program's efforts to help overheated kids stay cool during the summer.
Taxpayers have shelled out hundreds of thousands of dollars over the past year to install water playgrounds, known as "splashpads" and
"spray parks," all around the country. At least five were constructed in New Jersey, Nebraska,
Alabama and Massachusetts with nearly $3.5 million in funding from the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program.
CDBG funding is intended to provide "decent housing and a suitable living environment,
and by expanding economic opportunities,
principally for low- and moderate-income persons."<sup>[<a href="https://www.hudexchange.info/cdbg-entitlement/cdbg-entitlement-program-eligibility-requirements/" title=" Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD Exchange. &quot;CDBG Entitlement Program Eligibility Requirements.&quot Hudexchange.info.

So what is the role of the federal govern-

ment in this buddy dramedy about two American icons who lived in different eras? Taxpayers are helping fund the effort to bring RoosevElvis back to the stage, of course.
The National Endowment for the Arts gave
$10,000 to TEAM for their next run of RoosevElvis at a still-to-be-determined date before May

The play received a generally positive review from the New York Times, which was taken by the play's commentary on gender and masculinity, writing that RoosevElvis "offers a spirited and insightful commentary on two archetypes of American masculinity, while finding teasing ambiguities within both that suggest that machismo is a shaky existential choice."<sup>[<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/19/theater/reviews/roosevelvis-mashes-identities-at-the-bushwick-starr.html" title=" Brantley, Ben. &quot;Finding Your Flair, Pompadour Optional.&quot Nytimes.com.

derwear, with Teddy eventually riding around on Elvis's back as though he were a bucking bronco.<sup>[<a href="http://vimeo.com/album/1953386/video/77812652" title=" Roosevelvis Final Performances. The TEAM. Vimeo.com. 25 October 2013. Web. ">403</a>]</sup>
The review goes on to pan the play's excessive length, finding that after the roadtrip begins, it becomes like a television sitcom that
"jumps the shark" time and time again.<sup>[<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/19/theater/reviews/roosevelvis-mashes-identities-at-the-bushwick-starr.html" title=" Brantley, Ben. &quot;Finding Your Flair, Pompadour Optional.&quot Nytimes.com.

<h1>Exploding Claims of "Sleep Apnea" Threaten to Bankrupt VA Disability Program</h1>

<h2>$1.2 billion</h2>

Military personnel diagnosed with sleep apnea are given a 50 percent rating - and some believe it's causing an explosion of abuse in the VA's disability program.
The number of active and retired service members getting sleep apnea-related payments has surged in recent years. Today,
more than 143 J. A. Davidson and D. K. Beede, "Exercise training of late-pregnant and nonpregnant dairy cows affects physical fitness and acid-base homeostasis," Journal ofDairy Science, Vol. 92, No. 2, 2009; http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022-0302(09)70359-5/pdf .,000 service members are getting them, at a cost to taxpayers of $1.2 billion every year.425 By comparison, the number more than 143,000 service members are getting them, at a cost to taxpayers of $1.2 billion every year.<sup>[<a href="http://militaryadvantage.military.com/2014/02/sleep-apnea-boom-splits-vet-community/" title=" Philpott, Tom, "Sleep Apnea Boom Splits Vet Community."

Military Advantage. 25 February 2014. ">426</a>]</sup>
Sleep apnea affects as many as 18 million American, and is diagnosed through a combination of a physical exam and a sleep study.<sup>[<a href="http://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-disorders-problems/sleep-apnea" title=" National Sleep Foundation. &quot;Sleep Apnea.&quot Sleepfoundation.org. National Sleep Foundation. ">428</a>]</sup> While it can be a serious condition,
for most people it is easily treatable with
"lifestyle changes, mouthpieces, surgery, and breathing devices."<sup>[<a href="http://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-disorders-problems/sleep-apnea" title=" National Sleep Foundation. &quot;Sleep Apnea.&quot Sleepfoundation.org. National Sleep Foundation. ">429</a>]</sup>
When a service member claims a disability, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) determines the severity of the condition using a "rating" system.<sup>[<a href="http://www.benefits.va.gov/compensation/ratesindex.asp#combined" title=" Department of Veterans Affairs. "Benefit Rates." Benefits.va.gov. U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Web. ">430</a> Current VA policy rates someone with sleep apnea to have a rating of 50 percent, meaning fifty percent disabled. By contrast, Representative Tammy Duckworth, who served in the Army as a helicopter pilot, lost both of her legs in combat and had her right arm blown off.<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jun/27/rep-tammy-duckworth-double-amputee-slams-irs-worke/" title=" Chumley, Cheryl K. &quot;Rep. Tammy Duckworth, Double Amputee, Slams IRS Worker on Disability.&quot Washingtontimes.com. The Washington Times, LLC. 27 June 2013.Web. ">431</a>]</sup>
After the arm was reattached, her disability rating by the VA was 20 percent.<sup>[<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jun/27/rep-tammy-duckworth-double-amputee-slams-irs-worke/" title=" Chumley, Cheryl K. &quot;Rep.

One attorney,
Michael Webster,
represented a number of veterans seeking disability payments for what he believed to be questionable sleep apnea claims, and came to Congress demanding an investigation.
"Virtually every single family law case which

I have handled involving military members during the past three years has had the military retiree receiving a VA 'disability'
based upon sleep apnea," he told Congress,
adding "A recently retired colonel told me that military members approaching retirement are actually briefed that if they claim VA disability based on sleep apnea, then they receive an automatic 50 percent disability rating ..."<sup>[<a href="http://militaryadvantage.military.com/2014/02/sleep-apnea-boom-splits-vet-community/" title=" Philpott, Tom, &quot;Sleep Apnea Boom Splits Vet Community.&quot Militaryadvantage.military.com. Military Advantage. 25 February 2014. ">433</a>]</sup>
The VA itself has acknowledged the surge in sleep apnea claims, and taken steps to study the situation, but denies that there is any abuse in the system and defends the 50 percent rating.<sup>[<a href="http://militaryadvantage.military.com/2014/02/sleep-apnea-boom-splits-vet-community/" title=" Philpott, Tom, &quot;Sleep Apnea Boom Splits Vet Community.&quot Militaryadvantage.military.com. Military Advantage. 25 February 2014. ">434</a>]</sup> But critics allege the increase is nothing more than a scam on the VA disability system that takes resources away from veterans who are truly disabled.
Even the Philadelphia VA Medical Center's chief of sleep medicine has said the "majority"
of "people who have sleep apnea and are on treatment are not disabled."<sup>[<a href="http://www.military.com/benefits/2013/05/30/attorney-urges-an-end-to-sleep-apnea-claims-abuse.html" title=" Philpott, Tom. &quot;Attorney Urges End to Sleep Apnea Claims 'Abuse.'&quot Military.com. Military Advantage. Web. ">435</a>]</sup>
Some veterans have begun speaking out in letters to the editor, including one retired colonel with a Purple Heart who has had sleep apnea for 15 years, "I would never think of asking VA for a disability rating based on sleep apnea," calling the payments "a travesty."<sup>[<a href="http://militaryadvantage.military.com/2014/02/sleep-apnea-boom-splits-vet-community/" title=" Philpott, Tom, &quot;Sleep Apnea Boom Splits Vet Community.&quot Militaryadvantage.military.com. Military Advantage. 25 February 2014. ">436</a>]</sup>
Jeff Gottlob, a veterans service officer in Texas, agreed, "In my opinion, the automatic 50 percent rating for sleep apnea is excessive and being abused."<sup>[<a href="http://militaryadvantage.military.com/2014/02/sleep-apnea-boom-splits-vet-community/" title=" Philpott, Tom, &quot;Sleep Apnea Boom Splits Vet Community.&quot Militaryadvantage.military.com.

Retired staff sergeant, Frank Manno, was even more direct, "As a retired soldier I am extremely disappointed that Congress and the VA can't see how the sleep apnea issue is crossing the line of fraud and waste ... Did the military make us obese or overweight?"<sup>[<a href="http://militaryadvantage.military.com/2014/02/sleep-apnea-boom-splits-vet-community/" title=" Philpott, Tom, &quot;Sleep Apnea Boom Splits Vet Community.&quot Militaryadvantage.military.com.

<h2>$ 1 billion</h2>

The Pentagon is spending a billion dollars to destroy $16 billion in over purchases of military-grade ammunition. The amount of surplus ammunition is now so large that the cost of destroying it will equal the full years'
salary for over 54,000 Army privates.<sup>[<a href="http://www.goarmy.com/benefits/money/basic-pay-active-duty-soldiers.html" title=" U.S. Army. &quot;Benefits - Basic Pay: Active Duty Soldiers.&quot Goarmy.com. The United States Army. Web. Accessed 9 October 2014. ">439</a>]</sup>

Over time, the amount of ammunition deemed no longer necessary has grown to nearly 40 percent of the Army's total inventory: "According to an Army financial statement in June , the Army had about 39 percent of its total inventory (valued at about $16 billion) in a storage category for ammunition items that were excess to all the services' requirements."<sup>[<a href="http://www.gao.gov/assets/670/662161.pdf" title=" Merritt, Zina D.

If they build it, will they come? City hopes that $16 million dollar will revitalize "ghost mall."Road through "Ghost Mall"
Hopes to Scare Up Business

<h2>$16 million</h2>

Fulton Mall in downtown Fresno,
California - built in 's as the nation's second pedestrian mall - was once hailed as a landmark in landscape architecture. Today,
years of neglect have left it in disrepair with broken fountains, crumbling sculptures,
overgrown shrubbery and vacant buildings.
The City of Fresno is hoping a new influx of $16 million from the U.S. Department of Transportation will bring revitalization by helping build a road through the mall, reopening it to vehicle traffic.<sup>[<a href="http://www.dot.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/TIGER_2013_FactSheets.pdf" title=" U.S. Department of Transportation, &quot;Tiger Awards, 2013.&quot dot.gov.

KFSN-TV ABC. 29 June 2013. ">462</a>]</sup>
As retailers fled, the city government neglected to maintain the property and it deteriorated. A report commissioned by the city found:
The high design character of the Mall is

in stark contrast with its state of advanced physical deterioration. Partly because of its age, and partly because of poor maintenance over several decades, most of its design features are beginning to fail. The Mall's pavement is cracked throughout and in many locations is heaving due to interference by tree roots. ... The state of disrepair is so extreme,
that it is difficult for the casual observer to appreciate the design value of the Fulton Mall. ...
The state of buildings along the Mall projects a similarly forbidding image.<sup>[<a href="http://webapp.fresno.gov/FresnoPlans/FultonCorridor/FCSP_Ch_04_Fulton_Mall_0.pdf" title=" Website of the City of Fresno. &quot;Fresno Fulton Corridor Specific Plan, City of Fresno, California (Public Draft).&quot 14 October 2011. ">463</a>]</sup>
As the mall's buildings degraded, the vacancy rates skyrocketed to nearly three-quarters of the space in the mall's historic buildings sat empty.
In particular, most of the seven buildings along the Mall listed on the Local Register of Historic Places suffer from disinvestment, vacancy and disrepair. In  the City of Fresno estimated that the seven large historic office buildings on the Fulton Mall,

">464</a>]</sup>
The mall as a whole does not fare much better, which is over half empty, "The mall's 45

buildings have a 56% vacancy rate."<sup>[<a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/fresnomoving-tear-historic-pedestrian-mall" title=" Wozniacka, Gosia. &quot;Fresno Moving to Tear Up Historic Pedestrian Mall.&quot Ap.org. The Associated Press. 28 September 2013. ">465</a>]</sup>
For years, local officials debated what to do about the mall, including whether to tear it down.<sup>[<a href="http://fresnobeehive.com/archives/7524" title=" Oz, Mike. &quot;Fulton Mall: Kill it? Rename it? Preserve it?&quot FresnoBeehive.com. The Bee. 3 September 2010. Web. ">466</a>]</sup> Complicating matters, however, was a dark cloud of corruption stemming from a decades-long bribery scheme in which a developer paid off city government officials.
Fresno's long history of corrupt city planning efforts was documented in a  San Francisco Chronicle story highlighting what it called the city's "ghost malls," including Fulton Mall: "It has endless strip malls that make the town appear to be one huge franchise, a kind of Anywhere USA. The malls, some critics say,
are like cannibals -- new malls devour the older malls. At one end of town is the huge new River Park shopping center, which is booming; at the other is the East Gate mall, which is boarded up. Other regions have ghost towns:

The San Francisco Chronicle. 1 September 1999. ">467</a>]</sup>
Many wanted to build a road through the middle of the mall. However, a study commissioned by the City of Fresno found the road would have no discernible impact on transportation - the purpose of the specific Department of Transportation funding.
The  report found: "Fulton Street is not a critical component of the traffic and transit circulation network in downtown; therefore,
transportation should not drive decisions on the future of the Mall. Economic development opportunities and cultural factors should be the principal determinants along the Mall."<sup>[<a href="http://www.fresnocog.org/files/TransitDocs/Fresno%20Downtown%20Transportation%20and%20Infrastructure%20Study-Final.pdf" title=" Nolte, Carl. Fresno Council of Government, &quot;Downtown Transportation and Infrastructure Study (Prepared for the City of Fresno,&quot October 2007">468</a>]</sup>
Yet, when the $15.9 million in grant funding was announced, political leaders said the opposite, declaring it a major transportation initiative. "These TIGER projects are the best argument you can make for investment in our transportation infrastructure," said Secretary U.S. Transportation Secretary, Anthony Foxx,
"The Fulton Mall reconstruction project will revitalize Fresno's downtown business district, increase local economic activity and improve transportation options for residents."469 The City of Fresno.

Web. 17Oct. 2014. <Mayor Swearengin: 'Historic' Federal Grant Will Help Return Downtown Fresno to Prosperity>.
Perhaps the most notable aspect of the project, though, is not its multi-million dollar price tag, but the fact that the City of Fresno itself will not be spending its own money on something it has deemed an essential priority.
In describing the importance of the road, city council president Steve Brandau called the mall, "an economic Berlin Wall - the economy stops there."<sup>[<a href="http://www.fresnobee.com/2014/02/27/3794420/fresno-city-council-takes-key.html" title=" Hostetter, George. &quot;Reopen Fresno's Fulton Mall to traffic, City Council says in historic vote.&quot FresnoBee.com.

The Postal Service has an obligation to deliver mail to every part of the country
--- but this isn't mail. Ordinary pieces of mail can weigh up to 70 pounds, but these pallets often weigh well over 1,000 pounds, yet the postage is calculated based on Standard Post prices, per pound.
One can be sympathetic to the states that lack infrastructure to serve the needs

of remote residents, but whether the financially-strapped Postal Service (and perhaps the taxpayers eventually) should bear the cost is questionable. Also questionable is whether this subsidy actually helps those remote residents, or merely improves the profit of the middlemen providing the service. These airlines make a profit of about 15.5%, whereas the typical airline struggles to make a 3% profit margin.<sup>[<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/us-postal-service-losing-tens-of-millions-annually-subsidizing-shipments-to-alaska/2014/06/28/3d007fd6-e51a-11e3afc6-a1dd9407abcf_story.html?hpid=z1" title=" Rein, Lisa. &quot;U.S. Postal Service losing tens of millions annually subsidizing shipments to Alaska.&quot Washingtonpost.com.

the subsidized transportation reduces the incentive to make delivery more efficient.
If the taxpayer is paying for it, why reduce the cost?

There is no question the museum will generate interest and attract visitors and that the Grammy's and its associated organizations have more than enough resources, which is exactly why the museum does not need financial handouts from taxpayers.

<h1>Voicemails From the Future Warn of Post Apocalyptic World</h1>

<h2>$5.2 million</h2>

A disruption in the time-space continuum has somehow caused voicemails from the future to fall from the sky, warning everyone who hears them about the disastrous effects of global warming: Zombies on the loose,
airports underwater and bananas nearly impossible to find. So sets the stage for a game called FutureCoast, which attempts to teach people about what the future might hold if climate change makes the seas rise.<sup>[<a href="http://futurecoast.org/" title=" &quot;FutureCoast.&quot FutureCoast. Future Voices. Web. 17 Oct. 2014. ">489</a>]</sup>
It's all funded by the National Science Foundation using a portion of a $5.2 million grant to Columbia University given, in part,
to develop an interactive game to spur climate change activism.490 http://www.futurevoices.net/about/ FutureCoast is a "collaborative game" set in an alternative world where fictional voicemails have been transported back in time - cased in pieces of circular plastic called "chronofacts" - allowing people to listen in on what earthlings from the future say about the climate.<sup>[<a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-climate-fiction-cli-fi-game-sends-players-clues-from-the-future/" title=" Pyper, Julia, &quot;New Climate-Fiction (Cli-Fi) Game Sends Players Clues from the Future.&quot ScientificAmerican.com. The Scientific American. 1 May 2014. Web. ">491</a>]</sup>
Participants play along by discovering the location of chronofacts, which are stashed around the country in different locations -
all tagged with GPS coordinates. Every so often, the game's organizers will release the coordinates of one or two over Twitter,
allowing players to go out and search for them.
Once found, players load information from thechronofacts online and a new voicemail is made available on the FutureCoast website.492 See, e.g., FutureCoast, Twitter (June 2 2014, 3:03 PM EDT), https://twitter.com/FutrCoast/status/461206905655148544 (documenting the location of achronofact in Paris).

you will know what to do."497 When You See Them, FutureCoast, http://futurecoast.org/voicemail/48305-29152180/.

"create[s] the attractive narrative vacuum that people fill up with their stories - playfully,
yet with intention."<sup>[<a href="http://situationlab.org/2014/02/12/futurecoast/" title=" Candy, Stuart. &quot;Participatory Cli-fi: The Making of FutureCoast.&quot Weblog post.Situation Lab. N.p., 12 Feb. 2014. Web. 17 Oct. 2014. ">498</a>]</sup> In designing the game,
he tried to create a world "that has this ring of authenticity to it, even though it might be wildly fictional."<sup>[<a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/02/futurecoast-climate-change/" title=" Andersen, Michael."Voicemails from the Future Explore the Impact of Climate Change."

The game's producer, Sara Thacher,
believes the game allows people from different viewpoints to discuss climate change using

their voicemail messages.<sup>[<a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/02/futurecoast-climate-change/" title=" Andersen, Michael."Voicemails from the Future Explore the Impact of Climate Change."

Web. 7 February 2014. ">501</a>]</sup> Eklund agrees,
but adds that the game is more than that,
"We're looking for black swans. We're looking for people who have an insight about the future."
"I think that there are a lot of people who want to have an invitation to say something about climate change," Eklund continued,
"And I think this is the opportunity. It is this sort of creative challenge - you say it, but you say it in your future voice."<sup>[<a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/02/futurecoast-climate-change/" title=" Andersen, Michael.&quot;Voicemails from the Future Explore the Impact of Climate Change.&quot Wired.com.

In the end, the goal of the game was modest, according to its designers. Stephanie Pfirman, a professor affiliated with the project noted that the goal of the game wasn't necessarily to educate people on climate research, but rather to get people able to address the issue to simply think about it.<sup>[<a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-climate-fiction-cli-fi-game-sends-players-clues-from-the-future/" title=" Pyper, Julia, &quot;New Climate-Fiction (Cli-Fi) Game Sends Players Clues from the Future.&quot ScientificAmerican.com.

<h2>$1,437,966 in guarantees</h2>

The "happiest place on earth" got a little happier in  as taxpayers helped Walt Disney World renovate its Polynesian Resort.
When the Polynesian Village resort opened in , it was "one of the first on-site hotels at the Walt Disney World Resort."535 http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2013/08/ten-things-you-may-not-know-about-disneys-polynesian-resort-at-walt-disney-world-resort/ Today, it is undergoing a massive renovation to bring the resort up to date, all with a little help from the Small Business Administration.
The Small Business Administration provided a total of $1.4 million in surety bond guarantees to two firms hired by Disney, meaning if they fail to perform the taxpayer will step into make sure Disney is made whole. The first was

It operates nine of the world's ten most popular amusement parks,
which together bring in more than $2 billion in annual profit.

Disney's Polynesian Resort is one of Walt Disney World's most luxurious resorts, with rooms starting at $429.

<h1>Abandoned Pennsylvania Mall Wants to be the East Coast Hollywood</h1>
<h2>$15 million</h2>

Norristown, Pennsylvania, a beleaguered manufacturing hub, appears to have been swindled into the idea of transforming an old shuttered Sears department store into a sort of East Coast incarnation of Hollywood.<sup>[<a href="http://articles.philly.com/2014-02-17/news/47382264_1_jerry-nugent-charles-gallub-norristown" title=" Davis, Carolyn. &quot;The Long Road to a Failed Project in Norristown.&quot Philly.com.

The Sears store sits in a half-abandoned s-era mall about two miles north of downtown Norristown called Logan Square.
It is probably safe to say that most folks would greet any proposal claiming to be able to transform a hollowed-out old Philly mall like Logan Square into the next MGM with a raised eyebrow or roll of the eyes.<sup>[<a href="http://articles.philly.com/2014-02-17/news/47382264_1_jerry-nugent-charles-gallub-norristown" title=" Davis, Carolyn. &quot;The Long Road to a Failed Project in Norristown.&quot Philly.com.

named Charles Gallub bought up the old Logan Square property. In a masterful display of salesmanship, Gallub came before the county government with an astonishing plan.

It's a program that offloads some of the burden for producing and marketing locallygrown products, and places it on the backs of taxpayers. This fiscal year, the USDA provided
$4.5 million in grants to 28 recipients in 20 states, and footed the bill for all kinds of operating costs that are normally born by the businesses.<sup>[<a href="http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/supportdocuments/RD_2014VAPGRecipients.pdf" title=" USDA. &quot;Value-Added Producer Grant Awards Fiscal Year 2014.&quot Rurdev.usda.gov.

<h1>Roaches, Mice, and Feces in Public Housing Funded by Uncle Sam, Slumlord</h1>

<h1>DHS Buys Too Many Cars and Let's Them Sit Underused</h1>

<h2>$35 million</h2>

With the second largest vehicle fleet in the federal government, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) could save tens of millions in taxpayer dollars by reducing underused vehicles.
The DHS vehicle fleet is comprised of 56,000 vehicles costing $485 million to operate annually. Three DHS components,
Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE),
and the National Protection and Programs

Directorate (NPPD), maintain approximately 42,000 vehicles, or 75% of fleet.<sup>[<a href="http://www.oig.dhs.gov/assets/Mgmt/2014/OIG_14-126_Aug14.pdf" title=" Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General DHS Does Not Adequately Manage or Have Enforcement Authority Over Its Components' VehicleOperations.

DHS Office of Inspector General (OIG)
audited the vehicle fleet, by inspecting the use of hundreds of DHS vehicles across several DHS components.
Of the vehicles inspected, about twothirds were underused590 An "underused" vehicle is a vehicle that is driven less than 12,000 miles per annum.. With the average operating cost per vehicle at 88, $2,914,
and $8,329 for CBP, ICE, and NPPD vehicles respectively this adds up quite quickly. The

Inspector General estimated that the total amount wasted on underused vehicles to be between 5.3 and $48.6 million.<sup>[<a href="http://www.oig.dhs.gov/assets/Mgmt/2014/OIG_14-126_Aug14.pdf" title=" Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General DHS Does Not Adequately Manage or Have Enforcement Authority Over Its Components' VehicleOperations.

<h1>DOD Tries To Build Real-Life "Iron Man" Suit</h1>

<h2>$80 million</h2>

Government contractors have built a suit of military super-armor to withstand bullets and carry hundreds of pounds, all powered by futuristic energy source. No, that's not the plot of Hollywood's blockbuster movie series,
Iron Man, but the hope of Pentagon officials to bring science fiction to the battlefield.
The Department of Defense has set aside millions to try and create what it's calling a Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit (TALOS).
"We sometimes refer to it as the Iron Man suit,
frankly, to attract the attention, imagination and excitement of industry and academia,"
said Michael Fieldson, heading up the TALOS program.<sup>[<a href="http://www.army.mil/article/113332/" title=" Vergun, David, &quot;'Iron-Man-style Suit in Early Stages of Development.&quot Army.mil. Army News Service. 17 October 2013. Web. ">600</a>]</sup>
In addition to dozens of defense contractors and experts, the Pentagon is also collaborating with the big time Hollywood costume designers from movies such as Terminator,
RoboCop, Captain America, and Iron Man.<sup>[<a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/u-s-military-turns-to-hollywood-to-outfit-the-soldier-of-the-future-1404527893" title=" Nissenbaum, Dion, &quot;U.S. Military Turns to Hollywood to Outfit the Soldier of the Future.&quot Wsj.com. Dow Jones 601 Company. 4 July 2014. Web. ">601</a>]</sup>
"When you're doing something for a movie, it is all make-believe," said a founder of the Hollywood company that designed the Iron Man suit.<sup>[<a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/u-s-military-turns-to-hollywood-to-outfit-the-soldier-of-the-future-1404527893" title=" Nissenbaum, Dion, &quot;U.S. Military Turns to Hollywood to Outfit the Soldier of the Future.&quot Wsj.com. Dow Jones 602 Company. 4 July 2014. Web. ">602</a>]</sup> Crediting computer-generated special effects for the fictional technologies of the Iron Man suit, she explained that "for the military,
that's not really going to be the case."<sup>[<a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/u-s-military-turns-to-hollywood-to-outfit-the-soldier-of-the-future-1404527893" title=" Nissenbaum, Dion, &quot;U.S. Military Turns to Hollywood to Outfit the Soldier of the Future.&quot Wsj.com. Dow Jones 603 Company. 4 July 2014. Web. ">603</a>]</sup>
TALOS has an estimated budget of $80 million over the next four years,604 but one industry official of a large defense firm has predicted that the TALOS program will "need about a billion dollars" for a successful prototype.<sup>[<a href="http://io9.com/the-military-has-hiredhollywood-to-help-build-an-actua-1601102216" title=" Strauss, Mark. &quot;The Military Has Hired Hollywood to Help Build an Actual Iron Man Suit.&quot Io9.com. Kinja. 7 July 2014. ">605</a>]</sup>
Like most things in Washington, the cost of producing even the simplest of things often

cost many times what it would elsewhere, as one observer unwittingly noted. "To do it right,
they need about a billion dollars," said one industry official, adding, "Twenty million dollars a year in an R&D budget -- you couldn't even develop a pencil on that."<sup>[<a href="http://defensetech.org/2014/04/29/congress-wants-more-control-of-special-ops-iron-man-suit/" title=" Cox, Matt. &quot;Congress Wants More Control of Special Ops Iron Man Suit.&quot DefenseTech.org. Military Advantage. 29 April 2014. Web. ">606</a>]</sup>
That sentiment perfectly describes the problem with the military industrial complex-
they really honestly probably could not develop a pencil for DOD for only $20 million.
The Iron-Man suit would protect U.S. soldiers with body armor made of an agile exoskeleton, which could also carry hundreds of pounds of gear.<sup>[<a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/u-s-military-turns-to-hollywood-to-outfit-the-soldier-of-the-future-1404527893" title=" Nissenbaum, Dion, &quot;U.S. Military Turns to Hollywood to Outfit the Soldier of the Future.&quot Wsj.com. Dow Jones 607 Company. 4 July 2014. Web. ">607</a>]</sup>
However, not everyone in the defense industry thinks this is a good idea. A  study funded by the Department of Defense and the National Academy of Sciences found that soldiers' combat loads are far already too excessive, and that "the approach of acquiring and fielding every 'new' technology is both impractical and unaffordable.<sup>[<a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=18321" title=" Committee on Making the Soldier Decisive on Future Battlefields; Board on Army Science and Technology ; Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences;National Research Council. Making the Soldier Decisive on Future Battlefields. Washington: National Academies, 2013. Web. ">608</a>]</sup>
And while a promotional video for the TALOS program shows bullets ricocheting off a cartoon soldier dressed in the suit,609 field tests have so far found soldiers struggling to run,
dive, and shoot when using the real thing.<sup>[<a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/u-s-military-turns-to-hollywood-to-outfit-the-soldier-of-the-future-1404527893" title=" Nissenbaum, Dion, &quot;U.S. Military Turns to Hollywood to Outfit the Soldier of the Future.&quot Wsj.com.

helped support one of its traveling exhibits,
Target America, which was displayed at the Maryland Science Center.<sup>[<a href="http://www.usaspending.gov/explore?fiscal_year=all616comingfrom=searchresults616piid=DJD14HQP0715616typeofview=complete" title=" USASpending.gov, &quot;Prime Award Spending Data: DEA Office of Congressional 616 Public Affairs.&quot Web.

the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD)
system is the backbone of our ground-based missile defense system.
It is built around the hit-to-kill Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV) warhead,
which in theory intercepts and destroys an incoming ICBM in our upper atmosphere. The U.S. currently has 30 GMD Ground-Based Interceptors (GBIs) deployed in Alaska and California, and plans to deploy an additional 14 by , even though the system's performance has been marred by failure and final testing of the system's capabilities and limitations won't be completed until .630 testing of the system's capabilities and limitations won't be completed until 2022.<sup>[<a href="http://www.mda.mil/global/documents/pdf/gmdfacts.pdf" title=" &quot;Ground-based Midcourse Defense.&quot The Missile Defense Agency.

Web. ">631</a>]</sup> To meet the timeline, GMD was rushed into a high-risk, concurrent development, production, and fielding process known as "concurrency." In , the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that the program's "highly concurrent development,
production, and fielding strategy" had resulted in "disrupted production, increased costs, and delayed fielding" of the system.<sup>[<a href="http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-12-400SP" title=" Sullivan, Michael J.

Critics of the program remain skeptical that the system will ever be able to intercept an operational ICBM as intended. The Defense Department's Operational Test and Evaluation

And even at the lower velocity, the test results don't inspire confidence.

Even if the issues with the EKV can be resolved, the GMD system is designed to repel only a limited ICBM attack and would be easily overwhelmed by the simple countermeasures that would be deployed in a real attack, such as "decoys" designed to confuse the system,

Despite obvious flaws, the MDA and Congress are moving forward with a $1 billion decision based on a 30% success rate in tests that fail to replicate a real world scenario. Almost immediately after the June test results were announced, production of the EKV was resumed and the MDA announced it was moving forward with its plan to deploy the additional 14 missiles. Even more concerning,
Congress is moving to expand the program to develop an East Coast missile defense site,
at a potential cost of billions more for taxpayers-the House's version of the fiscal year

<h1>Jonas Bonus: Rich and Famous Rent Out Their Pads Tax Free</h1>

One provision in the tax code allows the rich and famous to rent out their property for short periods of time without reporting the revenue on their tax returns. This may seem inconsequential, but the celebs that rent out their digs for thousands per day sure appreciate it.

<h1>State Department Tweets @ Terrorists</h1>

<h2>$3 million</h2>

The State Department's Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications (CSCC) is responsible for crafting the official online presence of the U.S. government on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter with the mission to counter the sophisticated propaganda machines of terrorist groups around the globe. This year, a portion of the
$3 million671 Information provided by Department of State. taxpayers entrusted to CSCC was used to create the Think Again Turn Away Twitter account, which currently counts more than 2,000 tweets and 7,654 followers.672 U.S. Department of State. (ThinkAgain_DOS) Web. https://twitter.com/ThinkAgain_DOS>.
According to the State Department, the theory behind Think Again Turn Away is that it provides a counter to the tweets of "extremists [who]
were previously able to spread their bile without fear of pushback."673 Information provided by Department of State. Each tweet sent out by the CSCC's Digital Outreach Team is crafted to "redirect the conversation" and put the extremists "on the defensive" to make them
"aware that when they try to spread their message, they will encounter resistance."674 Information provided by Department of State.
There are of course no hard metrics on the campaign's impact on jihadist recruiting numbers. As evidence the campaign is having effect-"unnerving the adversary" in the parlance of this digital battlefield-the State Department cites the more than 80,000 views of a video titled "ISIS Kills Muslims," which it says "debunked [the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria
(ISIS)]'s role as self-proclaimed defender of Sunni Muslims," and the "extreme indignation" of "affiliated media units and avowed supporters of the group" who are targeted by the campaign.675 Information provided by Department of State.
The campaign falls short on even these rather squishy objectives.
Dubbed "trolling for terrorists," critics have questioned the utility of such a campaign that is "less set on converting would-be terrorists than simply preventing these accounts from running uninterrupted and unchallenged feeds."<sup>[<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140322/10393226658/state-dept-now-trolling-twitter-terrorists.shtml" title=" Cushing, Tim.

<h1>Border Patrol Builds Over-Priced Houses for Temporary Workers</h1>

<h2>$4.6 million</h2>

Quartz countertops, plantation shutters,
spacious open kitchens, three bedrooms and the latest in stainless steel appliances. No,
that's not a real estate ad from the nice part of town, but a description of ritzy housing units for Border Patrol agents in Ajo, Arizona.
The homes were purchased by Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) for agents reporting temporarily to Ajo, where few border agents live. However, a report by the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) inspector general found the agency "vastly overpaid"
for homes and built them far bigger than they should have.<sup>[<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2014/09/12/u-s-border-agency-vastly-overpaid-to-build-homes-for-agents-audit-says/" title=" Hicks, Josh, &quot;U.S. Border Agency 'Vastly Overpaid' To Build Homes for Agents, Audit Says.&quot Washingtonpost.com.

Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) - a component of DHS - devised a plan in 
to acquire housing units in several remote areas along the southwest border, and paid the General Services Administration $1.4 million to manage the project.<sup>[<a href="http://www.oig.dhs.gov/assets/Mgmt/2014/OIG_SLP_14-131_Sep14.pdf" title=" U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Office of Inspector General.

">682</a>]</sup> The project was badly mismanaged, though, leading to the inspector general accusing CBP of wasting $4.6 million.
To start, the agency paid "nearly $1 million for 12 acres of land," but the inspector general determined the price was "almost triple the amount it may have actually needed to pay" based on the local market.<sup>[<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2014/09/12/u-s-border-agency-vastly-overpaid-to-build-homes-for-agents-audit-says/" title="Hicks, Josh, &quot;U.S. Border Agency 'Vastly Overpaid' To Build Homes for Agents, Audit Says.&quot Washingtonpost.com. The Washington Post. 12 September 2014. Web.">683</a>]</sup>Next, CBP designed and built housing that exceeded employee needs. A 
CBP study to determine the housing needs for border agents stationed in Ajo found they would best be served by one-bedroom apartment-style housing for use during the workweek.<sup>[<a href="http://www.oig.dhs.gov/assets/Mgmt/2014/OIG_SLP_14-131_Sep14.pdf" title=" U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Office of Inspector General.

In part, prices were driven up because they equipped each house with expensive upgrades, such as quartz countertops,
stainless steel appliances, free-standing additional freezers, wireless ceiling fans,
plantation shutters, and walk-in pantries.<sup>[<a href="http://www.oig.dhs.gov/assets/Mgmt/2014/OIG_SLP_14-131_Sep14.pdf" title=" U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Office of Inspector General.

The new homes range from 1,276 to 1,570 square feet.
According to the DHS Office of

53 NASA Goes to Comic-Con,
Explores the Marvel Universe At l e a st $ 1 0,0 0 0

With its manned space program grounded,
NASA boldly voyaged to an extraterrestrial world of another kind this year- the Marvel Universe.
With appearances at Comic-Con International in San Diego, California and a Marvel Comic's exhibit in New York's Time Square, NASA launched missions into the worlds of science fiction and comic book superheroes.

the total budget for NASA's Mars Mission in

So why is NASA participating in the promotion of a movie that brought in enough revenue to rival the annual budget of its premier manned space mission of the future?

explained Bert Ulrich, liaison for film and TV collaborations at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. <sup>[<a href="http://www.space.com/26152avengers-shield-nasa-marvel.html" title=" Howell, Elizabeth. &quot;Avengers Assemble!

Another reason may be because NASA was one of the agencies that fared well in the budget deal approved by Congress this year.
Sequestration was set to trim the agency's budget from 6.9 billion to "as little as 6 billion," but instead NASA got a boost to $17.65 billion.<sup>[<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/01/14/spending-bill-would-preserve-major-nasa-missions/4480537/" title=" King, Ledyard. &quot;Budget Deal Would Preserve NASA's Big Missions.&quot Usatoday.com.

The extra money in the budget may also explain why NASA-which a year ago was warning
"its goals of future space travel may be put on hold" by budget concern-sent a manned mission to Comic-Con, which is an annual comic book convention "dedicated to creating awareness of,
and appreciation for, comics and related popular artforms," and celebrating "the historic and ongoing contribution of comics to art and culture."<sup>[<a href="http://www.comic-con.org/" title=" &quot;MISSION STATEMENT,&quot comic-con.org.

comprehensive $5 million proposal to renovate the entire 27 hole golf course along with constructing a new 6 hole junior course. The justification for the change from the original
$900,000 renovation to a full scale, three year renovation project was due to the fact that "the results of the tree survey in <sup>[<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/AG%20Memo%20re%20Budget%20Implications%20for%20the%20DOJ%20Workforce.pdf" title=".

The tree line that the FAA determined was not a safety hazard but was quickly overturned not even two weeks later was the basis for a $5 million taxpayer backed full scale course makeover. These suspiciously short timelines suggest the renovation plans may have already been completed under the assumption that the trees would need to be removed.
Even with the questionable set of events that led to the need for the trees to be re-

49
moved to meet FAA safety standards, only 14 of the 27 regulation holes needed to be redesigned due the impacts of the tree removal and fence adjustment. However, the golf course architect's proposal argued that the remaining 13 golf holes should be renovated to provide the golf course with consistent playing conditions and character.
The report says, "[t]he required reconstruction of such a large percentage of holes raises concern about the resulting mix of new and old holes. Visually, the individual holes will appear different because of the loss of trees. More importantly, the new

holes will play differently as a result of different turf conditions, drainage conditions,
irrigation coverage, soil compaction and soil mixes. Most obvious to the golfer will be the difference in the way which the golf ball will react on the greens."<sup>[<a href="http://www.sfairport.com/media/documents/sioux_falls_finalea_june_2013fonsirod.pdf " title=" Federal Aviation Administration. Final Environmental Assessment Runway Safety Area Improvements: Sioux Falls Regional Airport. Sioux Falls Airport Authority.Web. 22 July 2013. ">732</a>]</sup>
Thus, what began as a two hole change transformed into a 27 hole project. The three year golf course renovation is taking place in three phases of nine holes each, so that at least 18 holes will be playable during the entire project. The first phase was recently completed and the golf course is expected to complete phase two of the project

next summer. The president of Dakota Golf Management lauded the benefit the taxpayer funded renovation will have on the course,
stating "golf courses, you know, they have life spans and this is going to regenerate and rejuvenate Elmwood well into the future."<sup>[<a href="http://www.keloland.com/newsdetail.cfm/updates-underway-at-elmwood-golf-course/?id=152987" title=" Keloland TV. &quot;Updates Underway at Elmwood Golf Course.&quot Keloland.com.

In a possibly incriminating admission of how this project came to fruition, the President of Dakota Golf Management, Inc.
said that "obviously we wouldn't be doing it if we didn't think it's going to be a significant improvement."<sup>[<a href="http://www.keloland.com/newsdetail.cfm/elmwood-east-9not-up-to-par/?id=152538" title=" Jorgensen, Dan. &quot;Elmwood East 9: Not Up To Par.&quot Keloland.com.

<h1>NASA Study Predicts the Collapse of Human Civilization</h1>

<h2>$30,000</h2>

When the results of a provocative scientific research paper study hit the newsstands this past spring, a media firestorm erupted over a mathematician's claim that human civilization may be on the verge of collapse.
The study, officially titled "Human and Nature Dynamics (HANDY): Modeling Inequality and Use of Resources in the Collapse or Sustainability of Societies," (hereinafter referred to as "the HANDY study") was authored by University of Maryland researchers Safa Motesharrei and Eugenia Kalnay and University of Minnesota contributor Jorge Rivas. 757 Dr. Nafeez Ahmed, "Nasa-funded study: industrial civilisation headed for 'irreversible collapse'?" The Guardian, March 14, 2014; http://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2014/mar/14/nasa-civilisation-irreversible-collapse-study-scientists.
The paper posits the collapse of a modern and advanced civilization - such as our own - may be more prevalent that one might think. Specifically, it contends that historical data reveals the interchange of two social factors - the exploitation of resources and the unequal distribution of wealth - have often led to civilizational collapse. 758 Dr. Nafeez Ahmed, "Nasa-funded study: industrial civilisation headed for 'irreversible collapse'?" The Guardian, March 14, 2014; http://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2014/mar/14/nasa-civilisation-irreversible-collapse-study-scientists. As these factors become more prominent in present day society, a global collapse of the world as we know it "is not inevitable," according to thestudy. <sup>[<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2014/mar/14/nasa-civilisation-irreversible-collapse-study-scientists" title=" Ahmed, Nafeez. &quot;Nasa-funded Study: Industrial Civilisation Headed for 'Irreversible Collapse'?&quot theguardian.com. Guardian News and Media Limited. 14 March 2014. Web. ">759</a>]</sup>
A grant from NASA financed the questionable study, fueling many to express reservations regarding how NASA distributes its taxpayer-funded grant money. The study was funded in-part by a five-year cooperative agreement between NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center
(EESIC).<sup>[<a href="https://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgibin/npdv/contract.cgi" title=" NASA Procurement Data View - Contract Number Query, NASA. ">760</a>]</sup> The study examined "the impacts of Earth's connected systems on global and regional environment, weather and climate .

According to the NASA procurement database, the total five-year budget estimate for the grant is $36,334,811.<sup>[<a href="https://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgibin/npdv/contract.cgi" title=" NASA Procurement Data View - Contract Number Query, NASA.

This amount was allocated to numerous research projects and studies,
so it is unclear exactly how much of the money was used to fund the HANDY study. However,
in a summary of the cooperative grant agreement, NASA said the money used to fund the

HANDY study was "less than $30K."764 Summary of NASA activity relative to agreement NNX12AD03A and the study "Human and Nature Dynamics (HANDY) Modeling Inequality and Use of Resourcesin the Collapse or Sustainability of Societies," NASA, March 26, 2014.
The controversy that ensued should not have been surprising, given the audacity of the claim the researchers were making.
Warnings of global collapse are often seen as far-flung; thus, it is interesting NASA was involved in funding such a radical study.
The debate following the study's release was heated enough that NASA felt the need to issue a public statement in an attempt to distance the federal agency from it.<sup>[<a href="http://www.space.com/25160-nasa-statementcivilization-collapse-study.html" title=" Wall, Mike. &quot;NASA Clarifies Its Role in Civilization-Collapse Study.&quot Space.com. Purch. 20 March 2014. Web. ">765</a>]</sup> NASA stated the paper suggesting that social inequality and unsustainability could prompt the downfall of modern human civilization
"was not solicited, directed or reviewed by NASA. It is an independent study by the university researchers utilizing research tools developed for a separate NASA activity. As is the case with all independent research, the views and conclusions in the paper are those of the authors alone. NASA does not endorse the paper or its conclusions."<sup>[<a href="http://www.space.com/25160-nasa-statementcivilization-collapse-study.html" title=" Wall, Mike. &quot;NASA Clarifies Its Role in Civilization-Collapse Study.&quot Space.com. Purch. 20 March 2014. Web. ">766</a>]</sup>
Although NASA distanced itself from the paper's findings, the scientific space agency must do more to ensure its grant programs that are based in science fact instead of science fiction. Given that the HANDY study was labeled a "thought experiment" with admittedly "largely theoretical" contentions,
NASA's money could have likely been better spent elsewhere-or not spent at all.<sup>[<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2014/mar/14/nasa-civilisation-irreversible-collapse-study-scientists" title=" Ahmed, Nafeez. &quot;Nasa-funded Study: Industrial Civilisation Headed for 'Irreversible Collapse'?&quot theguardian.com.

Lance Eagen, art teacher at Churchill High School in Oregon, speaks for many teachers who see music education as always the first to go when budgets are tight.
"Art always, always falls afterwards," he complained after learning of new cuts at his school, "It's always scheduled after 'the real classes' are scheduled."<sup>[<a href="http://www.eugeneweekly.com/20130411/shortchanging-our-schools/budget-cuts-affect-music-arts" title=" Bridgman, Anne, &quot;Budget Cuts Affect Music, Arts.&quot Eugeneweek.com.

He might be surprised to learn, then,
that there was enough federal money lying around to send 25 teachers on an all-expense paid trip to Germany for several weeks over the summer to tour Europe and learn about Johann Sebastian Bach.

Once in Germany, most days featured morning lectures from Bach historians, but the teachers also enjoyed Baroque dancing lessons, which Moravian College claimed were absolutely "essential to understanding much of Bach's music."<sup>[<a href="http://www.moravian.edu/default.aspx?pageid=6283#.VEMjRvldV8E" title=" Moravian College.

the group was eager the join the locals in watching as many games as they could.

<h1>"Gateway to Blues" Museum Funded Over Deteriorating Bridges</h1>

The museum is expected to be a "must-see"

All we know is that the museum "will tell the remarkable story of how The Blues was born"

and there no longer is any reference to what collection will be displayed.797 See Gateway to the Blues Visitors Center, Tunica Convention 797 Visitors Bureau, http://www.tunicatravel.com/things-to-do/cultural-attractions/gateway.
In a time when the aging infrastructure is a looming national concern,798 the Department of Transportation (DOT) chose to allocate money to build a museum rather than repair roads and bridges. Mississippi, in fact,
is among the largest in the nation for having a substantial percentage of bridges deemed
"structurally deficient." There are 2,274 such state-operated bridges.<sup>[<a href="http://www.artba.org/economics/us-deficientbridges/" title=" American Road 799 Transportation Builders Association. &quot;U.S. Deficient Bridges.&quot artba.org.

Despite concerns about the availability of federal funding to study cures to the major diseases of the 21st Century, NIH shelled out a total of $533,, to investigate the effects of meditation not from scientific analysis, but from reading Buddhist texts.<sup>[<a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00973/full" title=" Lindahl, Jared R., Christopher T.

804 Undermining the NIH's demands for more funding, both of these studies, published in January , have concluded that Buddhist literature, not science, is key to understanding meditation experiences.<sup>[<a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00973/full" title=" Lindahl, Jared R., Christopher T.

<h1>"Get Fruved:" Social Media Campaign Featuring Students Dressed as Fruits and Vegetables</h1>

<h2>$5 million</h2>

At the University of Tennessee, students are dressing in their favorite fruit and vegetable costumes as they peruse campus,
telling peers and others in earshot to "fruve themselves."

Instilling healthy habits in our nation's children is important. The government's decision to take the initiative to promote sustainable lifestyles by eating well, exercising,
and managing stress is commendable.
However, spending close to $5 million dollars to a program without any clear guidelines and one where tangible results are not the best way to achieve these goals.
Negative public sentiments towards the
"Get Fruved" campaign are not surprising
- in a time of higher insurance premiums,
pay freezes and cuts, and other government spending reductions, many are not happy taxpayer money is being spent to craft a campaign that "creepy" fruit and vegetable costumes for college students.<sup>[<a href="http://dailycaller.com/2014/03/17/feds-spend-millions-dressing-creepy-students-up-as-fruits-vegetables" title=" Soave, Robby.

Further, the Fruved.com website,
which is supposed to be the initiative's main platform, is largely undeveloped. Other than a background of the project, none of the fruit and vegetable teams have tweeted or posted any updates on social media.
Other than some kids running around dressed up like bananas, it remains a mystery how they are spending taxpayer dollars.

<h1>USDA Holds Contest to Build Wooden Skyscraper</h1>

<h2>$2 million</h2>

The Big Bad Wolf can huff and puff all he wants, but he'll never blow this wooden building down. So hopes the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which is sponsoring a contest to design wooden skyscrapers -
known as "plyscrapers" - in an effort to boost the timber industry.
The administration will spend $2 million on a campaign to convince architects, engineers and developers that building high-rises with wood can be just as effective as steel.<sup>[<a href="http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?contentid=2014/03/0041.xml815contentidonly=true" title=" USDA.

a non-profit funded by the lumber industry,
while the second million will fund a contest

While the USDA hopes spending millionswill spur economic growth here at home, it may unintentionally be stimulating the European economy. With the exception of SmartLam,
a manufacturer of cross-laminated timber in Montana,817 "there are no U.S. manufacturers of this type of super-strong timber, so it would have to be imported from Europe," notes one architectural publication.818 Rodriguez, Julie M.

Web. http://inhabitat.com/usda-invests-2-million-in-sustainable-wooden-skyscraper-designs/>.
But as the one and only U.S.
manufacturer that stands to benefit from this taxpayer subsidy for timber, SmartLam came out strong to support the new $2 million timber investment. Casey Mahlmquist, the company's general manager, participated in a White House-sponsored event where he declared, "the future is wood and the future is good."<sup>[<a href="http://www.dailyinterlake.com/members/builder-part-of-white-house-workshop/article_a0eb02c6-b6eb-11e3-bc6a-001a4bcf887a.html" title=" Hintze, Lynnette, &quot;Builder part of White House workshop,&quot dailyinterlake.com.

Perhaps the stiffest resistance to using wood for constructing high-rise buildings comes from the engineers and developers within the industry. However, supporters are hoping that taxpayer funding for the industry will help move the dial.

<h1>Feds Waste Millions Trying to Convince Afghans to Grow Soybeans They Won't Eat</h1>

<h2>$34 million</h2>

Afghans don't like soybeans or soy-based products. What's more, the crop's growing cycle and water needs make it a poor choice for their country, as a British report concluded in .
None of that stopped the U.S. Department of Agriculture in  from committing to a years-long effort to encourage Afghans to cultivate, process and consume the crop.
USDA staff who made the decision reportedly weren't even aware of the research, and they did no feasibility study of their own before green-lighting the soy project. <sup>[<a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/07/25/afghans_don_t_like_tofu_either_soybeans_afghanistan" title=" Cohen, Alexander, and James Arkin. &quot;Afghans Don't Like Tofu, Either.&quotforeignpolicy. Foreign Policy. 25 July 2014. Web. ">834</a>]</sup>
Five years and $34 million later, the project was singled out as a flop by the Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction
(SIGAR), John Sopko. "I'm concerned about the viability of the project and the apparent lack of analysis and planning performed prior to the project's initiation," Sopko wrote USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack in June.<sup>[<a href="http://www.sigar.mil/pdf/Special%20Projects/SIGAR-14-69-SP.pdf" title=" &quot;SIGAR-14-69-SP,&quot Letter from SIGAR John Sopko to Tom Vilsack, Secretary, U.S. Department of Agriculture, 9 June 2014. Web. ">835</a>]</sup>
Experts in Afghanistan told Sopko there was no "significant demand for soybean products" there, despite five years of USDA efforts. Soy crops planted by farmers under USDA direction and funding failed, and Afghan consumers shunned products made with soy flour produced through the USDA program.<sup>[<a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/07/25/afghans_don_t_like_tofu_either_soybeans_afghanistan" title=" Cohen, Alexander, and James Arkin. &quot;Afghans Don't Like Tofu, Either.&quotforeignpolicy. Foreign Policy. 25 July 2014. Web. ">836</a>]</sup>
"What is troubling about this particular project is that it appears that many of these problems could have been foreseen and,
therefore, possibly avoided," Sopko wrote.<sup>[<a href="http://www.sigar.mil/pdf/Special%20Projects/SIGAR-14-69-SP.pdf" title=" &quot;SIGAR-14-69-SP,&quot Letter from SIGAR John Sopko to Tom Vilsack, Secretary, U.S. Department of Agriculture, 9 June 2014. Web. ">837</a>]</sup>
There were other problems too. Security concerns - including farmers who sometimes
"responded with guns in hand" when project staff tried to verify seeds had been received and planted - hampered the U.S. soy effort.<sup>[<a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/07/25/afghans_don_t_like_tofu_either_soybeans_afghanistan" title=" Cohen, Alexander, and James Arkin. &quot;Afghans Don't Like Tofu, Either.&quotforeignpolicy.

<h1>Corporate Welfare for Mega Farmers</h1>
<h2>$8,536,052</h2>

While taxpayers were voicing concern about corporate bailouts for Wall Street bankers, titans of industry located closer to home have been steadily receiving government grants. The Department of Agriculture (USDA) operates two programs designed to grow agricultural business and stimulate the introduction of products into markets. Under the Value-Added Producer Grants program, the USDA makes money available for people wishing to capitalize on recent food trends and developing new businesses.<sup>[<a href="https://www.cfda.gov/index?s=program839mode=form839tab=core839id=49ca2743a0169877e58643ed2f7e5544" title=" See Value-Added Producer Grants Program, CFDA, ">839</a>]</sup> Specifically, the USDA "help[s]
agricultural producers enter into value-added activities," which the program broadly defines as anything that generates new products and transforms what naturally exists (i.e.
milk to yogurt, pork to sausage), or is simply marketed or sold in a way that enhances its value (i.e. free-range, organic, etc.).<sup>[<a href="https://www.cfda.gov/index?s=program840mode=form840tab=core840id=49ca2743a0169877e58643ed2f7e5544" title=" See Value-Added Producer Grants Program, CFDA, ">840</a>]</sup>
Applicants can receive money either for a
"planning grant," which would fund a study to assess the viability of a proposed venture, or a
"working capital grant," which would provide money for operating costs that relate to the processing or marketing of the value-added product.<sup>[<a href="https://www.cfda.gov/index?s=program841mode=form841tab=core841id=49ca2743a0169877e58643ed2f7e5544" title=" See Value-Added Producer Grants Program, CFDA, ">841</a>]</sup>

Sunsweet, a marketing cooperative that
"boasts enviable brand recognition of 85 percent in American households," and leads by holding thirty percent of the worldwide prune market,847 also received the same amount to pay for costs of processing and marketing a prune juice. Each of these cooperatives has gotten capital injections entirely at the cost of taxpayers.
The USDA continues to operate another grant program, the Market Access Program
(MAP), which subsidizes the "costs of overseas marketing and promotional activities" for many more large businesses.<sup>[<a href="http://www.fas.usda.gov/programs/market-access-program-map" title=" Market Access Program, USDA Foreign Agricultural Service.

<h1>Unwanted, Unneeded and Unused Ice House</h1>

<h2>$965,000</h2>

A Louisiana community is wasting more than
$1.2 million for an ice house that is unwanted, unneeded, and probably will never be used.
In 2011, St. Bernard Parish spent $289,000 of HUD Community Development Block Grant
(CDBG) funds to purchase the Amigo Ice House property with the intent of providing ice to fishermen.<sup>[<a href="http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/08/st_bernard_government_reluctan.html" title=" Alexander-Bloch, Benjamin.

The parish found itself in a conundrum, either refund the federal government or spend another
$965,000 of federal funds to complete the unwanted, unnecessary, and most likely unused ice house project.
Local officials opted to waste more money,
which they tapped out of CDBG disaster recovery funds.<sup>[<a href="http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/08/st_bernard_government_reluctan.html" title=" Alexander-Bloch, Benjamin. &quot;St. Bernard Government Reluctantly Moves Forward With Ice House in Yscloskey.&quot Nola.com. NOLA Media Group. 6 August 2014.Web. ">860</a>]</sup>
There is no hiding the fact that the only reason another $1 million is being spent on the project is to avoid having to repay the original amount. St.
Bernard Parish officials "freely admit they don't think it's needed" and they are simply spendinga larger sum of federal money to get off the hook from repaying the original federal grant.<sup>[<a href="http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/08/st_bernard_government_reluctan.html" title=" Alexander-Bloch, Benjamin. &quot;St. Bernard Government Reluctantly Moves Forward With Ice House in Yscloskey.&quot Nola.com.

The aid for the Mayton Inn is being program. In a strange arrangement, if the loan is not repaid by the hotel owners, taxpayers get stuck footing the bill.

<h1>Transportation Dollars Fund Media Campaign to Raise Austin Taxes</h1>

<h2>$157,000</h2>

An extensive, and expensive, rail project for the City of Austin, Texas, is getting some fiscal assistance from Washington. Project Connect, the program management group spearheading transit for the Central Corridor Advisory Group in central Texas, has spent
$157,000 on an ad campaign to prop up public support to approve floating a billion dollar bond to help pay for the rail line.<sup>[<a href="http://austin.twcnews.com/content/news/303685/urban-rail-ad-campaign-under-fire/" title=" Stensland, Jeff. &quot;Urban Rail Ad Campaign Under Fire.&quot Austin.twcnews.com. Time Warner Cable Enterprises LLC. 2 August 2014. Web. ">902</a>]</sup>
The catch? Approximately 80% of the ad campaign is being financed with federal grant money, essentially using taxpayer money to encourage taxpayers to pay more taxes.
Critics have voiced concerns over the media campaign's funding sources and questioned want to know how it can be considered appropriate when "Taxpayers are paying money to the federal government, which is then turning around and lobbying Austinites to support more taxpayer spending."<sup>[<a href="http://austin.twcnews.com/content/news/303685/urban-rail-ad-campaign-under-fire/" title=" Stensland, Jeff. &quot;Urban Rail Ad Campaign Under Fire.&quot Austin.twcnews.com.

Time Warner Cable Enterprises LLC. 2 August 2014. Web. ">904</a>]</sup>
In addition to questions about how public funds have been used to shape public opinion, Project Connect changed the line route, invalidating public comments collected regarding the original plan. The change in route and need for a new round of public comments is required for Project Connect to seek additional funds from the Federal Transit Administration to finance the rail line.
Project Connect also spent time and money canvassing Austin with flyers that local groups claim provide misleading propaganda regarding the actual route and benefits of the line.<sup>[<a href="http://kut.org/post/why-projectconnect-handing-out-inaccurate-urban-rail-map" title=" Henry, Terrence.

<h1>Huge EPA Warehouse for Paper Reports Thwarts Recycling Efforts</h1>

<h2>$1.5 million</h2>

People sometimes think of hoarding as a problem that needs to be helped, and it seems an intervention is overdue for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Somewhat ironically,
an agency that encourages "green" behavior by others needs to take some of its own advice.
In its investigation into personal property being stored at sites used by the agency, the Inspector General discovered a warehouse the size of an average Walmart needing immediate attention.<sup>[<a href="http://www.epa.gov/oig/reports/2014/20140311-14-P-0132.pdf" title=" See generally U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Office of Inspector General.

Washington, D.C. 11 Mar. 2014. Web. ">918</a>]</sup> As it turns out, the EPA was storing 18.5 million publications and other materials.
Considerable is an understatement-shipping at an average of 3 million units per year, the EPA had an inventory of over six years' worth of material.<sup>[<a href="http://www.epa.gov/oig/reports/2014/2014031114-P-0132.pdf" title=" U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Office of Inspector General.

Washington, D.C. 11 Mar. 2014. Web. ">919</a>]</sup>
Hoarders sometimes try to change behavior when they are first alerted to it, but they rarely succeed without strong support. In this instance, the Inspector General discussed their findings with the EPA and the agency took steps to recycle 2 million items.<sup>[<a href="http://www.epa.gov/oig/reports/2014/2014031114-P-0132.pdf" title=" U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Office of Inspector General.

The agency is still storing around 5.5 years' worth of material. Given that the recycled items weighed in at 140 "The National Science Foundation: Under the Microscope," Office of Senator Tom Coburn, M.D., April 2011; http://www.coburn.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?a=Files.serve140File_id=2dccf06d-65fe-4087-b58d-b43ff68987fa . tons,921 perhaps the EPA just needs help discarding the rest of its waste.
The EPA is spending $1.2 million a year for storing and maintaining the excess materials and another 59,000 for leasing the space.<sup>[<a href="http://www.epa.gov/oig/reports/2014/2014031114-P-0132.pdf" title=" U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Office of Inspector General.

<h2>$3 billion</h2>

"Improper payment" is the bureaucratic term for a government payment in the wrong amount, to the wrong person, or used by the recipient inappropriately.<sup>[<a href="https://paymentaccuracy.gov/about-improper-payments" title=" PaymentAccuracy.gov.

While the food stamp program has been on a downward trend, from a 5% improper payment rate in  to a 3.4% improper payment , the government is actually projecting an increase in  to 3.8%.925 projecting an increase in 2014 to 3.8%.<sup>[<a href="https://paymentaccuracy.gov/tracked/supplementalnutrition-assistance-program-snap-2013#learnmore" title=" PaymentAccuracy.gov. &quot;Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).&quot 19 September 2014.

While that may seem insignificant, in a massive federal program like food stamps,
that slight shift amounts to a $400 million increase, bringing the total up to $3 billion just this year.<sup>[<a href="https://paymentaccuracy.gov/tracked/supplementalnutrition-assistance-program-snap-2013#learnmore" title=" PaymentAccuracy.gov. &quot;Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).&quot 19 September 2014.

Tennessee A Tennessee food stamp eligibility counselor created fake accounts that she exchanged for cash and drugs.
Earlier this year, officials at the state Department of Human Services (DHS)
became suspicious fraudulent Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)
accounts were being "created and sold for profit out of its Lebanon office." An eligibility counselor there "apparently tampered with government records to create the accounts"
and produce Electronic Benefit Transfer
(EBT) cards "in exchange for cash and drugs."
Investigators "identified more than 40 false accounts with more than $150,000 in benefits distributed fraudulently." The case remains "open, and more charges and suspects may be forthcoming."
The eligibility counselor has been fired.
In July, a Tennessee law also took effect requiring drug testing for those seeking welfare benefits. The law does not apply to eligibility counselors however.

<h1>Louisiana</h1>

In Louisiana, 11 were convicted this year for food stamp fraud. Nine of those convicted simply lied about their income to receive the benefits.<sup>[<a href="http://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/news/local/2014/09/30/louisiana-residents-convicted-public-benefits-fraud/16487489/" title=" Staff Report. &quot;11 Louisiana Residents Convicted of Public Benefits Fraud.&quot Shreveporttimes.com. Gannett. 2 October 2014. Web. ">927</a>]</sup> One woman deliberately hid

the fact that she was married and hid her spouse's income, taking in $17,755 in food stamps. Another woman stole the identity of another person to get their benefits.

Rhode Island In Providence, Rhode Island, 11 more were convicted after scamming the system for $3.6 million.<sup>[<a href="http://www.providencejournal.com/news/courts/20140921-sentences-handed-down-in-providence-food-stamp-fraud-case.ece" title=" Malinowski, W.

Under the rules of the program, only food items are supposed to be purchased. With cash in hand, the food stamp recipients are free to purchase whatever they please.

<h1>Injured ICE Employees Cleared to Work, Stay on Workers Comp Instead</h1>

<h2>$1 million</h2>

Despite being cleared to work, some Immigrations Customs and Enforcement (ICE)
employees received hundreds of thousands in workers compensation payments.
While the number of employees who have filed for workers compensation has steadily risen since , the Department of Homeland Security's own Office of Inspector General ("OIG") - thinks ICE has wholly failed to manage the costs of the program.
Most of problems involve ignoring requirements that the situation that caused

the injury be a covered activity that justifies a federal payment. In almost 20 percent of the claims reviewed by OIG, ICE failed to include the necessary evidence to make that decision,937 and in another 71 percent of the cases reviewed involving an accident in a government-owned vehicle, there was no evidence at all the employee was doing an on-duty activity eligible for pay.<sup>[<a href="http://www.oig.dhs.gov/assets/Mgmt/2014/OIG_14-105_Jul14.pdf" title=" DHS Office of Inspector General.

One federal worker received $43,225 in taxpayer funds without a single medical document justifying the workers

compensation pay. In all, 31% of cases reviewed by OIG lacked any medical evidence or other documentation to support an award.
Even federal employees who are able to work are reaping the benefits of this poorlyrun problem.
The OIG report found that five ICE employees continued received approximately
$1 million in workers' compensation payments even though they had already been cleared to return to work.<sup>[<a href="http://www.oig.dhs.gov/assets/Mgmt/2014/OIG_14-105_Jul14.pdf" title=" DHS Office of Inspector General.

<h1>Unbuilt Eisenhower Memorial Burning Through Cash</h1>

<h2>$1 million</h2>

Behind schedule, over-priced, tonedeaf, controversial and ugly. No, that's not a description of last year's federal budget - it's how some are describing the effort to build a memorial for President Dwight Eisenhower.
While construction was supposed to be completed seven years ago, it has yet to begin - and taxpayers have already spent $65 million.<sup>[<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/us/25eisenhower.html?_r=0" title=" Smith, Jada F., &quot;Eisenhower Memorial Moves Forward,&quot nytimes.com.

In , Congress first approved construction on the National Mall of a memorial to President Eisenhower,947 with plans for it to be open by .948 However, after 15 it to be open by 2007.<sup>[<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/us/25eisenhower.html?_r=0" title=" Smith, Jada F., "Eisenhower Memorial Moves Forward," nytimes.com. The New York Times Company. 24 September 2014. Web. ">948</a> However, after 15 years, even the design for the memorial has yet to be approved, with construction possibly several more years away.<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/us/25eisenhower.html?_r=0" title=" Smith, Jada F., &quot;Eisenhower Memorial Moves Forward,&quot nytimes.com. The New York Times Company. 24 September 2014. Web. ">949</a>]</sup>
Some have said questionable decisions by the Eisenhower Memorial Commission -
set up to build the memorial - lie at the heart of the delays and serious cost overruns.
The biggest of which has been picking a high-profile fight with the Eisenhower family over the memorial's design.
John Eisenhower, son of the late president, advocated for something simple, saying, "taxpayers and donors alike will be bet-

ter served with an Eisenhower Square that is a green space with a simple statue."950 Zongker, Brett, "Eisenhower Memorial Approval Delayed Into 2013," ap.com. Associated Press. 16 November 2012. Web. http://bigstory.ap.org/article/eisenhowermemorial-approval-delayed-2013>.
Instead, the commission pursued a design from well-known architect, Frank Gehry,
which many supporters inside and out of the family have strongly opposed for failing to capture Eisenhower's legacy.
According to an investigation by the House Committee on Natural Resources,
multiple designs were submitted by competitors, including Gehry, all of which were called "mediocre" by the design jury, which concluded, "[none] of the visions expressed the whole essence of Eisenhower."951 Committee on Natural Resources, Majority Staff. Five-Star Folly: An Investigation into the Cost Increases, Construction Delays, and Design Problems That Have Beena Disservice to the Effort to memorialize Dwight D. Eisenhower. U.S. House of Representatives. Web. http://naturalresources.house.gov/uploadedfiles/oversightreport113-eisenhowermemorial.pdf>.
Nonetheless, Gehry's was selected, leading one art critic to compare it with, "a scene from 'Planet of the Apes."<sup>[<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/us/25eisenhower.html?_r=0" title=" Smith, Jada F., &quot;Eisenhower Memorial Moves Forward,&quot nytimes.com. The New York Times Company. 24 September 2014. Web. ">952</a>]</sup>
One commission member, Bruce Cole,
was even harsher, dismissing the design as
"a blizzard of tapestries" and "a memorial to Gehry's ego rather than to Ike's accomplishments."<sup>[<a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/03/the-strange-fight-over-the-eisenhower-memorial.html" title=" Clift, Eleanor. "The Strange Fight Over the Eisenhower Memorial. Thedailybeast.com. The Daily Beast Company LLC. 3 September 2014. Web. ">953</a> Harvard urban designer, Alex Krieger, was equally brutal, saying that even as a "traditional first-semester architecture exercise," Gehry's design "would fail."<a href="http://www.rollcall.com/news/its_time_to_bury_frank_gehrys_eisenhower_memorial_commentary-230612-1.html" title=" Shubow, Justin. &quot;It's Time to Bury Frank Gehry's Eisenhower Memorial.&quot Rollcall.com CQ Roll Call. 3 February 2014. Web. ">954</a>]</sup>
The cost of the design left some scratch-

ing their heads. For his efforts, the commission paid Gehry's architecture firm 6.4 million, not counting an additional $13.3 million
"to the multiple parties responsible for managing the design process and providing administrative support."955 Committee on Natural Resources, Majority Staff. Five-Star Folly: An Investigation into the Cost Increases, Construction Delays, and Design Problems That Have Beena Disservice to the Effort to memorialize Dwight D. Eisenhower. U.S. House of Representatives. Web. http://naturalresources.house.gov/uploadedfiles/oversightreport113-eisenhowermemorial.pdf>. All of this accounted for a significant part of the nearly $65 million Congress has awarded thus far to help build the memorial.
Generating private financial support has also been slow-going. In , the commission "paid a private fundraising consultant more than $1.2 million ... but had received
$448,000 in donations through March
[].956
[2014].956 Roche, Sam. "It You Like Ike, Start Over With His Memorial." Wsj.com. Dow Jones 956 Company. 4 August 2014. Web. http://online.wsj.com/articles/sam-roche-ifyou-like-ike-start-over-with-his-memorial-1407195093>.
However, the cost is sure to go higher as the commission requested an additional $50 million this year to continue moving ahead.<sup>[<a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/uncertain-future-troubles-eisenhower-memorial-commission-and-its-insular-staff/article/2547245" title=" Rosiak, Luke, &quot;Uncertain Future Troubles Eisenhower Memorial Commission and its Insular Staff.&quot Washingtonexaminer.com. Washington Examiner. 15 April 2014.Web. ">957</a>]</sup>
Because of the complications, Congress only provided $1 million in , intended simply to keep the lights on.<sup>[<a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/uncertain-future-troubles-eisenhower-memorial-commission-and-its-insular-staff/article/2547245" title=" Rosiak, Luke, &quot;Uncertain Future Troubles Eisenhower Memorial Commission and its Insular Staff.&quot Washingtonexaminer.com. Washington Examiner. 15 April 2014.Web. ">958</a>]</sup>
The first major hurdle for the plan has been securing approval for the controversial design. Federal and District of Columbia rules required multiple rounds of approval, but in April  the National Planning Commission for D.C. rejected the Gehry proposal.959 Boyle, Katherine. "Planning Commission Goes to War with Gehry Partners Over Eisenhower Memorial." Washingtonpost.com. The Washington Post. 3 April 2014.

In the end, the question on everyone's mind is that uttered by Justin Shubow, president of the National Civic Art Society, when he asked, "Everyone wants to know, where is the money going?"<sup>[<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/us/25eisenhower.html?_r=0" title=" Smith, Jada F., &quot;Eisenhower Memorial Moves Forward,&quot nytimes.com.

Most electronic filers submit their taxes in February, several months before the IRS is able to verify their accuracy because of several month delay in receiving employer-provided W-2s.<sup>[<a href="http://www.gao.gov/assets/670/665368.pdf " title=" White, James R.

<h1>Feds Study Science Festival Attendance</h1>

<h2>$1,523,133</h2>

The federal government is spending a million and a half dollars to monitor your festival attendance. Science festivals, that is.
Each year states and private groups host hundreds of science festivals all over the country. Apparently, though, the hosts don't do a very good job of communicating with one another and getting data from their participants,
so they have a hard time figuring out if their efforts are helping the cause of science.
These aren't your grandparent's science fairs, either. A sampling of festivals include:
"Nerd Nite" at Sea on an aircraft carrier in San Francisco; "E=MC Beered," sponsored by the Philadelphia Science Festival and Yards Brewing Company; and "Science Ink," hosted by a body artist to discuss "science-y tattoos."<sup>[<a href="http://moreheadplanetarium.org/blog/index.php?cat=5" title=" UNC Morehead Planetarium and Science Center, Call for Event Submissions, 12 December 2013.

Researchers at University of California at San Francisco and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill are using the National Science Foundation grant money to help figure out whether all these festivals are actually making Americans love science. They are also developing a database for "the festival community"
to use to share information about their participants.<sup>[<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1423050" title=" National Science Foundation, Award Abstract #14223004. <http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1423004>; National Science Foundation,Award Abstract #1423050. ">991</a>]</sup>
In addition, the federal government is funding a three-year project (concluding in
) to support the development of more of these festivals and provide resources for mentoring and travel costs with the goal of creating a network of scientists and festival organizers.992 Science Festival Alliance, About the Science Festival Alliance, http://sciencefestivals.org/about/about-the-science-festival-alliance. 993 a network of scientists and festival organizers.992 <sup>[<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1423050" title=" National Science Foundation, Award Abstract #14223004. <http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1423004>; National Science Foundation,Award Abstract #1423050.

<h1>Five Decades of Controversy for Beleaguered Government Program</h1>

<h2>$1.7 billion</h2>

On its 50th anniversary, the $1.7 billion federal Job Corps program - the centers where American youth often go for their first job -- is been plagued by questions of ineffectiveness, violence and drug use at many of its job centers.
One Job Corps center in McKinney,
Texas is under federal investigation for violent crime and drug use. An official said

When questioned how the student was able to complete his junior and senior year in one week and the teacher said it was "not possible."<sup>[<a href="http://www.myfoxdfw.com/story/26206562/troubleat-the-job-corps-part-2" title=" Oliver, Becky, &quot;Investigation: Trouble at the Job Corps, part 2.&quot Myfoxfw.com. KDFW Fox4. 6 August 2014, ">1000</a>]</sup> Another teacher resigned due to immense pressure to graduate students even "if someone else has to sit with that mouse and click A, click B, click C, click D.
It does not matter who does it."<sup>[<a href="http://www.myfoxdfw.com/story/26206562/troubleat-the-job-corps-part-2" title=" Oliver, Becky, &quot;Investigation: Trouble at the Job Corps, part 2.&quot Myfoxfw.com. KDFW Fox4. 6 August 2014, ">1001</a>]</sup>
An article in the Washington Post

"I believe the Job Corps got lazy. I believe they stopped trying to help people and started going through the motions."
- former Job Corps student

the center has "an atrocious drug problem"
and others shared information about violent assaults resulting in students being taken to the hospital.<sup>[<a href="http://www.myfoxdfw.com/story/26195573/investigation-trouble-at-the-job-corps" title=" Oliver, Becky. &quot;Investigation: Trouble at the Job Corps.&quot Myfoxfw.com. KDFW Fox 4. 4 August 2014. Web. ">995</a>]</sup>
Job Corps has a supposed zero tolerance policy for drugs and violence.
However, a Safety and Security Manager at the north Texas center has said that he was told the center had an amnesty policy in which a student caught with drugs or weapons is allowed to stay at the center.<sup>[<a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-Texas/2014/07/23/Government-Funded-Youth-Program-Allegedly-Ridden-with-Corruption-Rape-Drug-Abuse" title=" Tate, Kristin. &quot;Government-Funded Youth Program Allegedly Ridden with Corruption, Rape, Drug Abuse.&quot Breitbart.com. Brietbart. 23 July 2014. Web. ">996</a>]</sup>
That manager was told not to contact the local police department about the violence and drug use.<sup>[<a href="http://www.myfoxdfw.com/story/26195573/investigation-trouble-at-the-job-corps" title=" Oliver, Becky. &quot;Investigation: Trouble at the Job Corps.&quot Myfoxfw.com. KDFW Fox 4. 4 August 2014. Web. ">997</a>]</sup>
Teachers at the McKinney center have also filed complaints that charge they were made to give students a "diploma by any means necessary," through "extensive fraud and cheating." <sup>[<a href="http://www.myfoxdfw.com/story/26206562/troubleat-the-job-corps-part-2" title=" Oliver, Becky, &quot;Investigation: Trouble at the Job Corps, part 2.&quot Myfoxfw.com. KDFW Fox4. 6 August 2014, ">998</a>]</sup> In one example, a student at the center began his freshman year of high school on February 21, , he was advanced to a sophomore two months later,
and graduated two weeks after that.<sup>[<a href="http://www.myfoxdfw.com/story/26206562/troubleat-the-job-corps-part-2" title=" Oliver, Becky, &quot;Investigation: Trouble at the Job Corps, part 2.&quot Myfoxfw.com. KDFW Fox4. 6 August 2014, ">999</a>]</sup>recently highlighted one of the worst performing Job Corps centers in the country:
Treasure Lake Job Corps in Indiahoma,
Oklahoma. One student said the center
"reminded her of a homeless shelter, full of people hustling and fighting," while another student posted on Facebook it "reminded me of bein bk in jail lol."1002 Fahrenthold, David A., "Great Society at 50: LBJ's Job Corps will cost taxpayers $1.7 billion this year. Does it work?" washingtonpost.com. The Washington Post. After years of poor performance and criticism, the Jobs Corps announced in August that it was closing the troubled center.<sup>[<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2014/08/28/job-corps-closing-troubled-center-in-oklahoma/" title=" Fahrenthold, David A. "Job Corps Closing Troubled Center in Oklahoma. 28 August 2014. Web. ">1003</a>]</sup>
Students are allowed to leave whenever they want. In fact, "Over the decades,
auditors found that many students quit before they graduated - homesick, bored,
or tired of conflicts with other students.
Today, about 59 percent complete all of their training. The rest leave early, with no penalty or requirement to pay money back."1004 Fahrenthold, David A., "Great Society at 50: LBJ's Job Corps will cost taxpayers $1.7 billion this year. Does it work?" washingtonpost.com. The Washington Post.
Despite the poor education the students receive, Job Corps costs taxpayers about $45,000 per student per year - more

than four years of tuition at the University of Texas. <sup>[<a href="http://www.myfoxdfw.com/story/26206562/troubleat-the-job-corps-part-2" title=" Oliver, Becky, &quot;Investigation: Trouble at the Job Corps, part 2.&quot Myfoxfw.com. KDFW Fox4. 6 August 2014, ">1005</a>]</sup>
One of the few studies of the program found that while there were positive short term effects in students' earnings, after four years, there was no virtually no difference between those who had attended Job Corps and those who had applied but not attended. 1006 Fahrenthold, David A., "Great Society at 50: LBJ's Job Corps will cost taxpayers $1.7 billion this year. Does it work?" washingtonpost.com. The Washington Post.
Yet, given anecdotes of past success stories - not to mention the fact that Job Corps centers can employ hundreds of staff in politicians' own districts - the program's massive cost is rarely questioned.
"'What you find is that the program
- from society's perspective - does not pay for itself... But it is a good deal for the enrollees themselves.' In Washington today, that much good is good enough."1007 Fahrenthold, David A., "Great Society at 50: LBJ's Job Corps will cost taxpayers $1.7 billion this year. Does it work?" washingtonpost.com. The Washington Post.
Congress recently passed the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, which authorizes nearly $13 billion in funding for the Job Corps program through fiscal year .

For many business owners, failure to comply with federal regulations can result in steep fines or orders to close up shop. But for the Burley Municipal Airport in Burley,
Idaho, failure to adhere to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) standards results in a

<h2>$ 4 0.5 million</h2>

Large objects may be hurtling toward Earth, but despite receiving a big budget for tracking efforts, NASA has no idea where most of them are.
NASA has operated the Near-Earth Object (NEO) Program since , when Congress first required the agency start tracking all large NEOs within 28 million miles of Earth's orbit.1090 "Large" NEOs were originally those with diameters greater than 1 kilometer. In 2005, Congress required NASA to track objects as small as 140 meters indiameter. The program is supposed to identify 90 percent of NEOs by .
Funding for the program has grown exponentially from  million in  to $40.5 million this year.<sup>[<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/508_2015_Budget_Estimates.pdf" title=" NASA. &quot;FY 2015 PRESIDENT'S BUDGET REQUEST SUMMARY.&quot Nasa.gov. Web. ">1091</a>]</sup> NASA had been allocated
$102 million in funding for this program since
 alone.1092 2008 alone.1092 Information provided by the Congressional Research Service.
Despite the massive funding increases,
earthlings are still in the dark about what objects are floating in space NASA still has little capability to identify NEOs because it has completely mismanaged the program and will not make its 
goal, according to the Office of Inspector General (OIG).1093 Dunn, Marcia. "NASA Inspector Blasts Asteroid Protection Program." Ap.org. The Associated Press. 15 September 2014. Web. http://bigstory.ap.org/article/nasainspector-blasts-asteroid-protection-program>. The OIG rung up NASA for a lack of collaboration, integration, and effective internal controls as reasons for the program's inability to accomplish its mission by .1094 by 2020.1094 Dunn, Marcia. "NASA Inspector Blasts Asteroid Protection Program." Ap.org. The Associated Press. 15 September 2014. Web. http://bigstory.ap.org/article/nasainspector-blasts-asteroid-protection-program>.
Like some comets in orbit, the NEO Program management keeps chasing its tail by not adopting measures to eliminate duplicative efforts between NASA-funded observatories. The NEO Program has not sought to establish alliances with other governmental agencies, NASA programs or foreign countries in conducting its work. For instance, both the Department of Defense and the National Science Foundation have Earth-based telescopes which could assist in identifying and tracking NEOs.<sup>[<a href="http://oig.nasa.gov/audits/reports/FY14/IG-14-030.pdf" title=" National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Office of Inspector General.

NASA's international partner could greatly enhance the program's capabilities. <sup>[<a href="http://oig.nasa.gov/audits/reports/FY14/IG-14-030.pdf" title=" National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Office of Inspector General.

Upon examining the NEO Program's long-term strategic approach, the OIG report disclosed that a lack of comprehensive
"strategic plan, integrated master schedule,
and cost estimates" have plagued program execution.<sup>[<a href="http://oig.nasa.gov/audits/reports/FY14/IG-14-030.pdf" title=" National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Office of Inspector General.

<h1>Medicaid Provider Taxes</h1>

<h2>$4 billion</h2>

States are taxing federal Medicaid payments to doctors and using the revenue to get even more federal funding, a trick that is worth billions of dollars a year.
The Medicaid program is jointly funded by the states and federal government. Uncle Sam matches a fraction of the funds that states allocate toward their programs. To boost the amount of funds they get from Uncle Sam, states use these "provider taxes."
But in many cases, most of the revenue from the tax comes from federal payments already made by Medicaid.
Provider taxes cannot be applied specifically to Medicaid providers, but they can be levied against specific categories of medical providers. The most commonly taxed is one in which the federal government pays most of the bills: nursing homes. Medicaid covers almost half of the cost of all nursing home care nationwide, and Medicare covers almost one-quarter.<sup>[<a href="http://www.crs.gov/pages/Reports.aspx?PRODCODE=R434831098Source=search" title=" Colello, Kirsten and Scott Talaga. Who Pays for Long-Term Services and Supports? A Fact Sheet. Rep. No. R43483. Washington, D.C.: Congressional ResearchService. 16 April 2014.Web.

Medicaid Provider Taxes. Rep. No. RS22843. Washington, D.C.: Congressional Research Service. 10 January 2013. Web. ">1099</a>]</sup> Other oft-utilized tax categories include inpatient and outpatient hospital services and facilities for individuals with developmental disabilities.
Congress scaled back the use of this practice in the '90s, but the loophole continues to yield billions of dollars in unintended federal spending for states. In  alone, its estimated cost is $4-5 billion annually.<sup>[<a href="http://www.fiscalcommission.gov/sites/fiscalcommission.gov/files/documents/TheMomentofTruth12_1_2010.pdf" title=" The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. The Moment of Truth. Washington, D.C.: The White House. December 2010 Web. ">1100</a>]</sup>
All Americans should have access to quality health care, but the provider tax gimmick is indicative of Congress' ineptitude in addressing the real issues facing the Medicaid program.

<h1>Earmark Spends Taxpayer Money to Send Coal to Germany</h1>

Officials at the Chippewa Valley Regional Airport are "pretty convinced" that the reason only 12% of air travelers in the region choose the airport is because the others who do not are "just not aware of the services available."<sup>[<a href="http://www.weau.com/home/headlines/Chippewa-Valley-Regional-Airport-receies-federal-marketing-grant-277825941.html" title=" Williams, Drew.

Gray Digital Media. 2 October 2014. Web. ">1112</a>]</sup>
That explanation was good enough for the Federal Aviation Administration, which awarded the airport $150,000 to market the airport's services.<sup>[<a href="http://www.weau.com/home/headlines/Chippewa-Valley-Regional-Airport-receies-federal-marketing-grant-277825941.html" title=" Williams, Drew. &quot;Chippewa Valley Regional Airport Receives Federal Marketing Grant.&quot Weau.com. Gray Digital Media. 2 October 2014. Web. ">1113</a>]</sup>
But what really drives airport choice? Cost and convenience.
Because the airport only serves Chicago O'Hare International Airport, any destination other than Chicago requires a connection there, driving up the cost and inconvenience of the travel choice.
For example, a nonstop round trip weekend ticket in December from Minneapolis to Denver cost around $145.1114 Source: www.kayak.com, as of October 2, 2014. The same ticket departing from Chippewa Valley Airport costs $433 and requires an hour layover in Chicago.1115 Source: www.kayak.com, as of October 2, 2014. It is understandable that locals would choose a 90 minute drive and a cheaper nonstop ticket over a shorter drive and a more expensive ticket with a layover.
Even a round trip ticket to Chippewa Valley's only destination, Chicago O'Hare, is cheaper out of Minneapolis (2) than out of the regional airport ($178).
Chippewa Valley Regional Airport can market their services, but in an age where online price-comparison for airfare is a click away, savvy travelers will always pick cheaper, more convenient airfare despite any federally funded marketing scheme.
